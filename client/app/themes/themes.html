<div class="alert alert-success"><strong>For Developers:</strong> A theme must have page templates. Those are the structure your page has without or without any content. A template must have a valid template name, followed by a -template.html or -template.jade, such as "no-sidebar-template.jade". A theme must also have a screenshot for the theme and a theme.json file with the author, email, website, title, and description. It may optionally also have a styles.html and scripts.html that will be included in the master index.html page when the theme is loaded or activated.</div>
