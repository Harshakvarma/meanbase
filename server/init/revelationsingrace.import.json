I was born and raised in Nashville and since then have moved many times. I love computers, technology, music, writing, airsoft, video games, audiobooks, and movies. I went to a church now called Grace Center for the majority of my life and a wonderful youth group. I was saved when I was 4. I suppose you would say I'm from a non-denominational background. I'm currently in college for a web design degree. I love listening to Joseph Prince and John Sheasby and their messages of grace. I love spending time with God, talking with him and learning about him in a way that is life giving.\r\n\r\nHere is a simply way to contact me, I hope my spam filter does not erase your message. I apologize for any missed messages that may have been deleted as spam. Feel free to ask questions or comment! I would love to get in touch with you! Thanks!\r\n\r\n[contact-form subject='Revelations in Grace'][contact-field label='Name' type='name'/][contact-field label='Email' type='email' required='1'/][contact-field label='Comment' type='textarea' required='1'/][/contact-form]",

My name is Jon Paul. I'm glad you stopped by to say hello. I've been a Christian all my life and have a wonderful relationship with my God. Out of that I have a lot on my heart to share about and I hope you stick around to enjoy my thoughts. A couple years ago I began listening to Joseph Prince, a pastor of a church in Singapore, and became ecstatic to learn and share the good news of God's kindness and grace. I love to talk about God's grace. Shortly into my teenage years, the Lord gave me a passion for encouraging, strengthening, and building people up. Over the years, as I've encouraged people I found that some of the people I would encourage one day would be right back in their misery the next. I realized that religion within christianity was holding these people back from life. That combined with my own experiences with religious systems lead me to understand that the greatest encouragement and life comes when the heart and mind have been renewed from a religious, systematic way of approaching God and living in a personal, life-giving relationship with Him. That's why I'm writing this blog. Everything I write is with the purpose to encourage and bring enjoyment to life with God. Sometimes my thoughts may be offensive since much of the time I do confront religious systems. Please understand that when you read my posts. It is not my goal to be offensive, and my words are not always perfect. I want to encourage you to have an open mind and consider the things I say when you read and if you don't agree, don't worry about it, I don't take offense. But, if you are encouraged by what you read, come back for more!</p>",

I want to encourage you to make a lifestyle out of asking God for anything you need or want. He loves to give, especially to his children, and it honors him when you make your requests. The scripture says, <em>\"It is more blessed to give, than to receive.\" </em>God must always take the place of the more blessed one. God does not give as we humans give. He has no limits and no bounds and does not give despitefully. For, <em>\"Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.\" </em>God is a cheerful giver. When asking God for things, we must remember why he gives. <em>\"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes, he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich\" (2 Corinthians 8:9). </em>God gives to love you and to honor his son and the price he paid for you to be rich.\r\n\r\nUnder the Old Covenant, we were required to do good in order to receive. Now we receive blessings and favor because Jesus was willing to earn God's blessings for us. For when our sins and curse were imparted to him, his righteousness and blessings were imparted to us.\r\n<blockquote>\"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.” He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit\" (Galatians 3:13-14).</blockquote>\r\nTherefore God gives as an act of 'unmerited favor', not based on your merits. That's why James 1:5 says <em>\"God, who gives generously to all without finding fault\". </em>Scripture also says,\r\n\r\n<em>\"how much more will those who receive God's abundant <strong>provision of grace</strong> and of the <strong>gift of righteousness</strong> reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ\"</em> (Romans 5:17).<em> </em>\r\n\r\n<em>\"</em><em>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are “Yes” in Christ. And so through him the “Amen” is spoken by us to the glory of God\" (2 Corinthians 1:20).</em>\r\n\r\nYou have heard it written that God blesses the righteous and hears their prayers (1 Peter 3:12). James 5:16 also says, <em>\"The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.\"</em> Proverbs 15:29 <em>\"The LORD is far from the wicked, But He hears the prayer of the righteous.\"</em> We who have accepted the credibility of Christ's work for us have this righteousness as a free gift so that we qualify for his blessings.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 1:17 says, <em>\"For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.” Later he says, \"21 But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. 22 This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe\" (Romans 3).</em>\r\n\r\n\"However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness\" (Romans 4:5).\r\n\r\n\"David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works\" (Romans 4:6).\r\n\r\n\"It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption\" (1 Corinthians 1:30).\"God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God\" (2 Corinthians 5:21).\r\n\r\n\"and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith\" (Philippians 3:9).</blockquote>\r\nBecause of this righteousness through Christ, God now hears our prayers and blesses us. So when we ask, we don't come before him listing our own merits as if we are to convince him to bless us because of how many good things we've done. But, we ask in the name of Jesus, on the basis of Jesus's merits, work, and grace. Here I have listed some verses about asking:\r\n<blockquote>I tell you, if you ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy will be complete” (John 16:23-24).\r\n\r\n\"For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. Now suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish; he will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he? (Luke 11:10-11)\r\n\r\n\"Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God\" (Philippians 4:6).\r\n\r\n“And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus”\r\n(Philippians 4:19 NIV).\r\n\r\n\"but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment\" (1 Timothy 6:17).\r\n\r\n\"Delight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart\" (Psalm 37:4).\r\n\r\n\"You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it\" (John 14:14).\r\n\r\n\"You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you\" (John 15:16).\r\n\r\n\"In that day you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you\" (John 16:23).\r\n\r\n\"If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him\" (James 1:5-6).\r\n\r\n\"For whoever has, more will be given to him, and he will have more than enough\" (Matthew 13:12).\r\n\r\nHe replied, \"I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you\" (Matthew 17:20).\r\n\r\n\"He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?\" (Romans 8:32).\r\n\r\n\"You do not have, because you do not ask God\" (James 4:2).\r\n\r\n\"you fill me with joy in you presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand\" (Psalm 16:11).\r\n\r\n\"This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. [15] And if we know that he hears us — whatever we ask — we know that we have what we asked of him\" (1 John 5:14-15). What qualifies as God's will? I think it safe to say that if it makes God look good, He's pleased to give it.\r\n\r\n\"Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God [22] and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him\" (1 John 3:21-22).\r\n\r\n\"If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you\" (John 15:7). What does it mean to remain in him? Jesus is talking to fellow Jews right before his crucifixion. He is calling them from under the old convenant into the new covenant with him. The Jews were God's people and sons of God under the old covenant and Jesus is asking them to remain his children by following him into the new covenant. Because under the new covenant, being a Jew and obeying the law is no longer what makes you a son, but rather accepting Jesus's sacrifice is the qualifier of sonship. Therefore, Jesus is asking them continue to be his children by qualifying under the new covenant.\r\n\r\n\"If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer\" (Matthew 21:21).\r\n\r\n\"Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven. [20] For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them\" (Matthew 18:19-20).\r\n\r\n\"I will proclaim the decree of the LORD :\r\nHe said to me, \"You are my Son [a] ;\r\ntoday I have become your Father. [b]\r\nAsk of me,\r\nand I will make the nations your inheritance,\r\nthe ends of the earth your possession\" (Psalm 2:7-8).\r\n\r\n\"The blessing of the LORD brings wealth, and he adds no trouble to it\" (Prov 10:22).\r\n\r\n\"He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them\" (Psalm 145:19).\r\n\r\n\"O LORD, You have heard the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their heart, You will incline Your ear\" (Psalm 10:17).\r\n\r\n\"What the wicked fears will come upon him, But the desire of the righteous will be granted\" (Proverbs 11:23).\r\n\r\n\"You have given him his heart's desire, And You have not withheld the request of his lips\" (Psalm 21:2).\r\n\r\n\"I will answer them before they even call to me. While they are still talking to me about their needs, I will go ahead and answer their prayers!\" (Isaiah 65:24).\r\n\r\n\"Before a word is on my tongue you know it completely, O Lord\" (Psalm 139:4).\r\n\r\n\"Lord, you know the hopes of the helpless. Surely you will listen to their cries and comfort them\" (Psalm 10:17).\r\n\r\n\"What mighty praise, O God, belongs to you in Zion. We will fulfill our vows to you, for you answer our prayers, and to you all people will come. ...5 You faithfully answer our prayers with awesome deeds, O God our savior\" (Psalm 65:1-2, 5).\r\n\r\n\"Listen closely to my prayer, O Lord; hear my urgent cry. I will call to you whenever trouble strikes,\r\nand you will answer me\" (Psalm 86:6-7).\r\n\r\n\"Now glory be to God! By his mighty power at work within us, he is able to accomplish infinitely more than we would ever dare to ask or hope\" (Ephesians 3:20).\r\n\r\n\"And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work. Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness. You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God\" (2 Corinthians 9:8,10-11).\r\n\r\n\"But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well\" (Matthew 6:33).</blockquote>\r\nWhat's amazing about these verses is that they are not just words on a page, but truth that can be experienced in your personal life. I have countless stories of asking and receiving small and grand things. It was God himself who originally taught me to ask him for things and he answered hundreds of my prayers. Once, I was walking in a piano store and remembered that God wanted me to ask him for things. So I asked him for a Yamaha 7 foot grand piano with midi registration (a feature that costs $2,000). Two years later, a family calls us and asks if we could store their grand piano in our house. We now have a 5.2 foot Yamaha grand piano with midi-registration with us. When we first got it, it was originally placed in my room which was too small for a 7 foot piano. So, I understand why it was 5.2 rather than 7.\r\n\r\nAnother time, I asked God for new keyboard sounds through virtual instruments. A few days later, a man at church said he was upgrading to Pro-Tools and wanted to give me Logic Pro (his old software) since he no longer needed it. It came with hundreds of free keyboard sounds. Then I asked God for a car. A year later, my uncle and aunt said they wanted to give our family their mini-van. My parents gave it to me. When I was in college, I had no money for a new cell phone but I wanted a really nice smart phone. I asked God and two weeks later I received a free smart phone with the specific features I had asked God for.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions I have asked God to eat out at restaurants and soon afterwards had people say they wanted to take me to a restaurant and pay for me. I once asked him for studio foam and a new firebox, which usually costs a few hundred dollars. A couple months later, my grandfather called and asked if I wanted any of his old studio equipment. He gave me a couple hundred dollars worth of studio foam and a firebox for free. Another time I was sitting at a restaurant with my family and asked God to pay for the meal after hearing my parents worry about the cost. The Lord told me he would do it. At the end of the meal, our waiter came out and said that the manager wanted to pay for all of our meals. The list goes on and on. One time I was asking God for a particular microphone. Two days later, my brother found that microphone sitting in a cabinet in our garage. I was amazed but was hoping for a brand-new microphone instead of one that may be damaged. A year later, my friend asked to borrow it. He accidentally broke it and bought us a brand new one.\r\n\r\nOne time, I was in the restroom after a wednesday night youth conference. I was thinking about how I wanted to be on film and have opportunities to act and be in front of a camera. I asked God while I was in the restroom for opportunities to do so. When I walked out of the restroom a film crew from LifeWay was standing in the hallway. I was the only one nearby, so they asked me if they could interview me for a film they were making. I said yes and was interviewed on camera for the next few minutes. LifeWay was not even supposed to be in our youth building. They said they were driving past our building and randomly decided to stop by. We have rarely had film crews in our youth building, so that was quite a coincidence.\r\n\r\nWith all the things I was asking God for, I began to feel guilty as if I was asking for too much. When I addressed the Lord about it he said, \"He who asks for much shall be given much. But, he who asks for little shall be given little.\" Therefore I became even more eager to 'make my requests known to God.' Don't grow discouraged if it seems God is ignoring your prayers. Just don't feel ashamed about asking him for the things you desire. Even if that means being so bold as to ask him to answer quickly. He always answers even if it takes time. Remember my piano and car story? The piano took 2 years, the car took 1 year. During that time I highly doubted God could or would give me a several thousand dollar piano or free car. After all, what had I done to deserve it? But, now I have that piano with me and I enjoy it daily. Even though some prayers may take some time to answer, don't give up in believing God will answer your prayer. But, not all prayers take a while to answer. Remember my other stories? Keyboard sounds in a couple days, studio stuff in a couple months, new cell phone in a couple of weeks, a camera opportunity in a couple minutes, etc... The scripture says, \"I will answer them before they even call to me. While they are still talking to me about their needs, I will go ahead and answer their prayers!\" (Isaiah 65:24).\r\n\r\nGenerally what will happen is this. A man will say a prayer to God and doubt in his heart that God would ever consider his prayer. Perhaps he believes his prayer is not \"churchy\" enough. Perhaps he is asking for a video game. Or perhaps he doesn't feel like he's done enough to deserve it. What will then happen is after some time has passed, the man is say in his heart, \"I guess God isn't going to answer my prayer, that's what I knew would happen,\" and stops looking for the answer and goes on with his life. A time after that, God will answer his prayer and give him the very thing he asked for. However, because the man was not paying attention he forgets that what was given to him was actually the result of his prayer. So he goes on believing God doesn't answer his prayers. I find person after person in this situation that are assuming God isn't answering their prayers and aren't paying attention when he actually does. So their prayers are being answered, they are just not noticing it. That why I also pray that God would show me how He is answering my prayer. God isn't ashamed of you if you don't notice, but He does want you to believe He answers your prayers, even the non-churchy ones or the things you've asked for that you don't deserve.\r\n\r\nWhen we go through times where it seems God isn't answering, we can continue to plant the seeds of our prayers so we receive an even larger harvest when its season arrives. A friend of mine went through a time when it seemed God wasn't answering his prayers. He was discouraged and had almost given up on asking God for things. A few months later, the majority of his prayers were answered in an unexpected way and his discouragement left. God is faithful to his children.",

          "content:encoded": "<p>I'm a christian, saved when I was four years old through my parents. I went to a church called Grace Center (once known as Abounding Grace) since I was one years old. I went there for 19 years consistently and still do somewhat. My age group was taught how to prophesy since 3rd grade and for years we practiced hearing the Lord's voice to encourage, strengthen, and build up each other. <br />      Now, I was saved at four but that didn't mean much to me until I was around ten. That's when I heard stories of people who had experienced heaven and rose from the dead. From the stories I glimpsed the manifestation of what God's goodness looked like. Since then I became eager to know the God who would make such a wonderful heaven for his children. Over the next few years in youth group I built friendships, listened to sermons, worshiped God, and grew a personal relationship with Him. <br />     Around the age of 13, I began to experience God on a regular basis like no one else I know. I enjoyed the sound of His voice, his perfect words, the warmth of his presence, and his spirit which transformed my heart weekly. I irreversibly fell in love with the God who loves me more than I can describe. I didn't need anyone to tell me to love God or tell me what He wanted. I had been loved by God personally and was learning from Him. My relationship with Him became the soul focus of my life. <br />     About the age of 15, I was mislead by many old covenant teachings that tangled me up into religion, works, the law, strife, guilt, and emptiness. Suddenly, the God I knew so intimately was separated from me in order to \"discipline\" me to \"act better\". I was tormented daily for four years in the belief that God was bringing pain into my life because I wasn't good enough for Him. Yet, He would never tell me what I was doing wrong and as far as I and those close to me knew, I wasn't doing anything wrong. My thoughts were, \"Why would he discipline me for something that He's not telling me I'm supposed to be doing?\" I did everything I was told to perfection, exhausting myself with guilt for the smallest mistake. My life crumbled down, my friendships burdened, my joy retreated, I could no longer hear God's voice and experience his presence like I used to. My love for Him hid behind anger. One day the teacher of my voice class looked at me with compassion and said, \"There is absolutely no joy in your eyes.\" <i>That's the way He wants me,</i> I thought. <br />     Around age 19 my life hit rock bottom. About that time, I began hearing the message of Grace from a pastor named Joseph Prince. The news was too good for me to believe all at once. Much of what was said went over my head. But at the same time, I began hearing God's voice again and experiencing his presence. The pain in my life dropped immensely and I stopped attributing it to God. I remember the Lord romancing me with His kindness and love and singing over me in delight. I continued listening to Joseph Prince and God and slowly began emerging from the darkness of religion. Over the past couple years, the Lord began lifting me out of discouragement showing me that He wanted to teach me personally. So I learned about God through God, finding the fullness of my relationship (the one I had when 14) restored. I found friends who had come through similar life changes with God and learned of another pastor who preached grace, John Sheasby. Between God, John, and Joseph Prince I grew in love and my heart was strengthened by Grace. I realized that the reason I couldn't receive grace in the past was because I had been trying to mix it with works, religion, the law. When I began being freed from those, it was as if I was hearing grace for the first time. I encouraged friends at my college and went around teaching Grace to the students and sharing whatever the Lord gave me for them. Lives were transformed and they encouraged me to continue speaking. <br />      Today, I am more free than I have been my whole life. The heaviness, demands, worries, and stresses of life have fallen off of my shoulders because I know a secret that you may not hear in many sermons. God is not looking at our sins, He has forgot them. Instead when He sees us believers, He sees us as perfect as Jesus! This is the victory we have in Christ and his love is so exciting I can't help but share it! That's why I have this blog.</p>",

          "content:encoded": "<p>John Sheasby gave a great sermon on our privilege as being sons rather than friends. Luke 11 says,</p><blockquote><p>\"5 Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose you have <b>a friend</b>, and you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread; 6 a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.’ 7 And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, <b>and my children and I are in bed</b>. I can’t get up and give you anything.’ 8 I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your <i>persistence</i> he will surely get up and give you as much as you need. 9 “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 10 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. 11 “Which of you fathers, if <b>your son </b><i>asks</i> for a fish, will give him a snake instead? 12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 13 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” </p></blockquote><p>So now let me ask you a question. Are you the friend on the outside having to persist in asking to receive gifts from God or are you one of the children in bed with your father? The friend must persist to receive. The child simply has to ask. I have heard this passage taught as, \"You must persist in prayer! If you don't persist and give up God won't hear you.\" It seems there is a certain number of times you must pray in order for your prayer to be answered. Let me ask you another question. How many times do you think you must pray in order to be heard?</p><p>Once?</p><p>People pray for the same thing over and over because they think God did not hear them the first time. God does not neglect the prayer for the righteous. He is not deaf, he will answer their prayers. Jesus's point in this passage was not to say there is a certain number of times you must pray in order for God to hear you. What he is saying is that, if the evil man who cares nothing for the asker will grant him his request because of persistence, how much more so will the good father, who cares deeply for you, grant your request. Even if God didn't care for you or your prayer He would still answer your request just to get you to stop bugging Him. Jesus is trying to give the people confidence that God will answer their prayer, not to tell them He won't.</p><blockquote><p>\"When you pray, don't babble on and on as people of other religions do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again\" (Matthew 6:7).</p></blockquote>",

          "content:encoded": "<p>Have you ever heard sermons on the importance of forgiveness and how we are to forgive our neighbor regardless of their crime? I believe many people as myself have experienced a reluctancy or desire to hold onto judgement rather than forgive as if to forgive someone was an accomplishment of great effort. Its as if that forgiveness did not come from our nature but was contrived. We would say I forgive you with our words, but our heart held onto the pain. This reluctancy is not something I want to have in me but rather is a frustration and irritation that wars against what I desire to do. Why should I hesitate to forgive and why should my heart be so encumbered by such a command? Is it because I am selfish? I have found my answer to this question and seen my heart turned around, but the answer originally offended me. If you're willing to potentially be offended, I'll share my revelation with you.</p><p>The truth is, we treat others as we believe God treats us. If he is not forgiving my sins why should I forgive someone else's sins? Or perhaps I should say, when I believe I have to do things in order to be forgiven... conditional forgiveness, I place those same conditions on others. If I have to make atonement for my crime to be forgiven then my heart requires others to make atonement for their crimes in order to forgive them. These then were the reasons my heart was reluctant. \"Why should I forgive someone who didn't say they are sorry if God does not forgive me unless I am sorry? Should I be better than God?\"</p><p>The essence of the problem is this: The same people who taught me to forgive unconditionally forgot to teach me that I am forgiven unconditionally. Until I can receive unconditional forgiveness, my heart will never see it as fair to give forgiveness to someone that way. Yet, some people are afraid that teaching forgiveness and the grace of God will lead people into sin. So they mix the forgiveness with some work of our own so that we still have to put effort into attaining it. This teaching of conditional forgiveness leads to reluctant obedience. For, <em>\"He who is forgiven much loves much. He who is forgiven little loves little.\"</em> Remember the woman caught in adultery? God turned aside her accusers and forgave her unconditionally. The woman did not continue in her sin but had the power to be free of it.</p><p>The knowledge that we are unconditionally forgiven leads to love, not sin, and a willingness to do what is right. Grace desires to be shared. It is the same joy that someone might get when receiving a million dollars. They will celebrate with their friends and share their wealth so they may enjoy it with someone. In the same way, when someone is unconditionally forgiven they desire to share their joy with others by showing the same grace to them. Conditional forgiveness does not have this effect because it is always uncertain and is not given in joy but under compulsion as a reward for whatever service required it. II Peter, chapter 1 describes the fruits of forgiveness as follows: </p><blockquote><p>\"5 For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; 6 and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; 7 and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. 8 For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 9 But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, <b>forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins</b>.\" </p></blockquote><p>You see, unless these people know they are forgiven they do not grow in the fruits of forgiveness. The greater the conditions, the less forgiveness I receive and the less of its fruit I find in my life. Therefore instead of being afraid of teaching unconditional forgiveness, we must embrace it if we are to see people radically transformed. This is the offense I endured. The offense of laying aside all the conditions I had put on forgiveness. Some might say you have to make some kind of restitution others say you must be able to turn away from the sin and do good in order to be forgiven. I know that sounds wise and good, but in practice it is miserable and does not produce godly fruit. In order to be perfectly forgiven, the man would have to be perfectly flawless, which God calls a hopeless case. This is essentially saying I have to earn my righteousness, earn my way into heaven, deserve of my own merits. That belief can be summarized as, \"I'm forgiven only of sins I don't commit.\" This kind of belief puts no reliance on God. For if forgiveness is conditional, then it doesn't rely on God. Our only responsibility is to accept forgiveness as it is. Forgiveness is not a loan, it cancels the debt, it does not extend it. Forgiveness does not say, if you promise to do better in the future I will pardon you now. This is another man-made condition that must be removed from forgiveness.</p><p>Also confession, I believe has been misunderstood. I believe confession has a value for someone who is not aware of their forgiveness and carries guilt, but I do not believe it is a requirement to obtain it. There are two places in the new testament that talk about confession. The first one was addressing gnostics who didn't believe in the existence of sin. The argument that was being made was that without sin, forgiveness is not needed and salvation is impossible. Therefore one must confess that he has sins in order to receive forgiveness. For why would you need forgiveness if there was no penalty to begin with? Such a belief would cause a person to ignore the gospel all together. This not being a continual practice to obtain it but rather a one time event and heart change that allows the heart to accept forgiveness and the salvation of Jesus. </p><p>James 5 also mentions confession as a privilege that can be indulged because we are forgiven. <em>\"13Is any one of you in trouble? He should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise. 14Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. 15And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. <b>If he has sinned, he will be forgiven.</b> 16Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.\" </em></p><p>The verse does not say, if he confesses he will be forgiven. But rather, if he has sinned, he will be forgiven. I do not think this verse is saying that confession is necessary to receive forgiveness. I see this confession as a way to release our consciences from the guilt and be healed. We are forgiven even before we confess our sins which is why we can have the confidence to confess. Guilt is not always a problem, but sometimes we loose sight of the fact we are forgiven and need someone to remind us. Confessing our sins can release the guilt if it has been dragging us down. Because of this, I do not think it is beneficial to confess your sins to someone who will not remind you that you are forgiven. Such a practice only brings condemnation and produces sour fruit. If they penalize you, then confession has lost its value. The reason I argue this is because my heart can never believe it is completely forgiven if it also believes forgiveness is conditional, because it will always worry that it has not confessed every sin. And if I do not know that I am forgiven, how can its fruit grow in my life? As good as the belief of confess to be forgiven sounds, I believe its more of a hinderance than a benefactor to a godly life.</p><p>Because Christ is the sacrifice of atonement that reconciled you to God, your high priest, and your sacrifice you are now justified apart from any wrong you could do. Forever more you are completely forgiven once and for all of all your sins (Hebrews 10:14), and set free from every sin (Acts 13:39). They will never again be remembered by any means (Hebrews 10:17), never put on record (1 Corinthians 13:5), never counted against you (Romans 4:8). They will be covered over (Romans 4:7) and thrown as far away as the east is from the west (Psalm 103:12). You are saved to the uttermost for all time (Hebrews 7:25), You will never have to make atonement, reconcilement, sacrifice, or do any religious ritual to cleanse yourself or make up for your faults (Hebrews). This is what justification means and this justification comes only through faith in Christ. Once I asked the Lord, \"Do you only forgive people who are willing to turn from their sin?\" The Lord answered, \"I forgive people who are willing to be forgiven.\" Receive your forgiveness because its not conditional upon your works!</p>",

          "content:encoded": "<b>No Longer Under Law</b>\r\nI'm going to attempt to talk about a rather controversial topic in the church. That issue is addressing how the new covenant believer should relate to the law. I hope the experience is enlightening, freeing, and life-giving. If you feel strongly that we are still under the law, please realize that I am not advocating sin or saying it is proper for the christian to behave sinfully, but rather I am showing a way in which we can effectively live in the righteousness and freedom that God puts in us.\r\n\r\nThe switch from living under law to living under grace is a fantastic and humbling experience. Under the new covenant, Paul teaches us that we are no longer under the law but under grace (Romans 6:14). But, telling somebody that they are no longer under the law can be offensive to them and maybe even frightening. I hope you don't feel this way and I myself was at one time like this, for I had lived under the law for years before realizing Christ has set us free from it.\r\n<blockquote>\"You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace... Brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished\" (Galatians 5:4,11).</blockquote>\r\nThe message of the cross is offensive, because it takes our eyes off of ourselves and puts them on Christ. We no longer are trying to earn righteousness, justification, and blessings through our human effort but we receive it as a gift from the spirit. The law is wise and good (Romans 7:12), but the essential problem is, it cannot make you good (Romans 7:5,9,10 and Galatians 2:21 and Galatians 3:21). But it will expose your faults and make you aware of sin (Romans 3:20). This is its primary biblical purpose, to lead you to Christ by proving that you cannot earn righteousness and need his righteousness to justify you. Once you have Christ, you are no longer under the supervision of the law.\r\n<blockquote>\"Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith. 25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor\" (Galatians 3:23-25).</blockquote>\r\nDoes this mean that we act contrary to its good nature? By no means, we have it written in our hearts and minds through the spirit so that we do by nature the things required by the law (Hebrews 10:16).\r\n<blockquote>\"14 Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do <b>by nature</b> things required by the law... even though they <b>do not have the law</b>... 15 They show that the <b>requirements of the law are written on their hearts</b>, their consciences also bearing witness\" (Romans 2).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Well then, if we emphasize faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law? Of course not! In fact, only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law\" (Romans 3:31).</blockquote>\r\nWhat Paul is arguing in the book of Romans is that the believer is no longer under law, but he clarifies saying, 'does this mean we go on sinning, using our freedom to disobey the law?' 'Not at all,' he states. He is saying that it is only the people who operate by faith rather than the law who are actually fulfilling it's purpose, to bring us to Christ. To understand what he is saying, requires us to understand the nature of the law and faith. The law is not based on faith,\r\n<blockquote>\"The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, “The person who does these things will live by them” (Galatians 3:12).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"For if those who depend on the law are heirs, faith means nothing and the promise is worthless, 15 because the law brings wrath\" (Romans 4:14).</blockquote>\r\nThe law, even though it is good, does not produce good in the believer but rather inspires sin! In Romans, he realized that even though he willed to do good, the law only brought out the sin that was in him.\r\n<blockquote>\"But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin was dead. 9 Once I was alive apart from the law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died. 10 I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. 11 For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.\" (Romans 7:8-11).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, 21 so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord\" (Romans 5:20).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"For when we were in the realm of the flesh,[a] the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death. 6 But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code\" (Romans 7:5).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18 For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature.[c] For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.\r\n\r\n21 So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22 For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; 23 but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? 25 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!\" (Romans 7:14-25).\r\n\r\n\"The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law\" (1 Corinthians 15:56).</blockquote>\r\nSo, though the law is good and spiritual it cannot make a man good, in fact, it only stirs up his sin. Do you see the irony of trying to live under the law? The more devoted, passionate, determined you are at fulfilling the law, the more tempting and difficult sin becomes to you. So, is right behavior impossible? Not at all! But, we must realize where right behavior comes from. It does not come through the law. It is because we have become a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17) and because we have the Holy Spirit and a new nature motivating us (2 Corinthians 3:18) and leading us into the expression of the righteousness we already possess through Christ (2 Corinthians 5:21) that we desire to do what's right (Philippians 2:13). This faith, a faith that we have been made completely righteous by Christ alone, produces the good works prescribed in the law. Without this knowledge is the fear that some people suffer, a fear of sinning because of their newly found freedom. But, God has given us another way to pursue righteousness. This righteousness is no longer earned through human effort, but rather is imparted through the Spirit through the power of knowing you are forgiven, righteousness, and holy already. And while the spirit is changing our outward behaviors, God's grace continues to forgive and see us as having already been made perfect.\r\n<blockquote>\"Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes\" (Ephesians 1:4).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more\" (Isaiah 43:25).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"In those days, at that time,\" declares the LORD, \"search will be made for Israel's guilt, but there will be none, and for the sins of Judah, but none will be found, for I will forgive the remnant I spare\" (Jeremiah 50:20).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins\" (Romans 11:27).</blockquote>\r\nSo, what's the difference between pursuing righteousness through the law, and pursuing righteousness through the spirit? Before I answer this question, I want to take a moment to address a belief that the law can be separated and that believers are only freed from the ritualistic law, not the 10 commandments.\r\n\r\n<b>The Complete Law</b>\r\nIn Romans 7:7, he says,\r\n<blockquote>\"What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was <b>if the law had not said, \"Do not covet.\"</b></blockquote>\r\n'Do not covet' is not written in the mosaic law, it is written in the 10 commandments.\r\n<blockquote>Also in 2 Corinthians 3:7-8 he says, \"Now if the ministry that brought death, which was <b>engraved in letters on stone,</b> came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was, will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?\"</blockquote>\r\nThe ritualistic law was never written and engraved on stone. The 10 commandments were. Paul calls the 10 commands the ministry of death, even though it had glory. In Romans he refers to this law that brings death, it is the same 10 commandments, not just the ritualistic law. Another question I want to pose is this, are you aware that the law says you must keep the sabbath? If you believe we are still under the law, then keeping the sabbath is just as important as any other law. I know the law is good, and it presents praiseworthy standards, however it cannot make you good and as long as you are bound to it, to that degree you struggle with sin.\r\n\r\n<b>The Law</b>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_411\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://revelationsingrace.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/the-ten1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-411\" src=\"http://revelationsingrace.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/the-ten1.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"The Law\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> The ministry of death and condemnation[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b></b>\r\n<span style=\"line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;\">The Law demands what it cannot give. But, Grace gives what it cannot demand. The law was designed to bring out your sin, not your righteousness. It remembers your sin and forgets that you are righteousness. It activates the flesh, our man-power, will, effort, and sinful nature with which it is impossible to fulfill the law (Romans 7:5-11). Because of this it can never impart righteousness to us nor can it change our hearts (Galatians 3:21). It motivates through punishment/curse (Deuteronomy 28:15), condemnation, guilt (2 Corinthians 3:7-9), and fear. It is not based on faith (Galatians 3:12). It teaches you the awareness of sin and causes you to be self-introspective, monitoring, judging, criticizing yourself and others.</span>\r\n<blockquote>\"Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.\" (Romans 3:20).</blockquote>\r\nIn Romans 7, Paul describes the result our nature contrives from living under the law in this passage.\r\n<blockquote>\"14 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18 For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature.[c] For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.\r\n\r\n21 So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22 For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; 23 but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? 25 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!\r\n\r\nSo then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature[d] a slave to the law of sin.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe law may be able to tell you what is right and wrong and convict you of sin, but when people try to earn righteousness through the law by human effort, they end up in the same situation that Paul was in, desiring to do good but not having the ability to carry it out. The law cannot produce the fruits of forgiveness or love (2 Peter 1:9). Its knowledge will keep you distant from God, fearing encountering him or drawing close to him because it disqualifies you from his presence (2 Corinthians 3:15).\r\n\r\n<b>The Spirit of Grace</b>\r\nBut, God has given us an Influencer much greater than the law and our willpower to change our behavior. The Spirit, through grace and love (Zechariah 12:10), reminds us of our righteousness (1 Corinthians 2:12), writes God's law on our hearts, and conquers the flesh (Romans 8:13). It does not motivate through guilt (Hebrews 10:22), condemnation (Romans 8:1), curse (Galatians 3:13) and fear (1 John 4:18). God's grace keeps no record of your sins (1 Corinthians 13:5). Romans 1:17 says, \"For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: \"The righteous will live by faith.\" Have you wondered how people can live righteous? How they get their act together and are able to do right? I believe this verse is not only talking about righteousness in our standing with God but that the secret to right living is found in this verse. It is through faith. We saw a moment ago what righteousness looks like under human effort. 'The evil I do not want to do, this I keep on doing.' But here the verse says the righteous shall <b>live</b> by faith. The law is not based on faith, as Galatians 3:12 says, \"The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, 'The person who does these things will live by them.'\" But a secret to right living is found in Paul's conclusion in the passage we recently read from him. We see all through Romans 7 and even through the entire book of Romans Paul has been getting to a point. Romans 7 is the climax and when Romans 8 opens up, he releases his insight.\r\n<blockquote>\"1Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,a 2because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. 3For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh , God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering.c And so he condemned sin in sinful man,d 4in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe Greek word for flesh not only means the sinful nature, that part in our humanness that desires sin, but it is also translated 'human effort.' Consider what this could mean in his statement that the requirements of the law might be fully meet in those who live according to the spirit not according to the flesh, or 'human effort'. Paul could be saying that the righeous requirements of the law are fulfilled not through human effort but through the spirit. Paul has been giving us the keys to right living and behaving in these previous verses. It is not by human effort or willpower, but it is by faith, through the spirit, and with no condemnation. Galatians 5:5 says, \"But by faith, the eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope.\" 2 Peter 1:9 also says, \"But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.\" By 'them', he is referring to the list of godly traits he mentioned earlier that should be growing in every believer. In this statement, he is saying that the reason a person lacks them is because he has forgotten that his past sins have been cleansed, or in other words, is living under condemnation. So then, those of us who desire to do good should not seek this right doing through the law, but through faith by waiting through the spirit for that righteousness to be imparted as a gift. Then we will see not only outward modification, but inward transformation!\r\n\r\nUnder the definition of the new covenant spoken by God, He not only saves us from the punishment and condemnation of our sin, but he no longer remembers them. \"Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more” (Hebrews 10:17). Remember the big sins you've committed throughout your life? And the ones you may have committed recently? God doesn't remember them. Unlike the law, God does not teach you the awareness of your sin, it has left his consciousness. You might argue, I don't believe it is accurate to say God is not aware of our sins, that He has forgotten them. Ephesians 1:4 says, \"Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes.\" If God knows your sins and faults and calls your holy and without fault in His eyes, do you need to be conscious of your sins?\r\n<blockquote>\"For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins\" (Hebrews 10:2). Another translation says, \"Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins?\"</blockquote>\r\nThrough Christ, we have been cleansed once and for all (Hebrews 10:10). This is a point that is strongly emphasized throughout Hebrews. Thus, the consequence of our forgiveness and cleansing is that we no longer bask in the guilt, consciousness, and memory of our sins. We learn to be love-conscious, conscious of Christ's love for us. That is a far greater motivator to good works than a loveless motivator. The law is a loveless motivator, because it keeps record of our sins, while love keeps no record of sins. Love covers over a multitude of sin (1 Peter 4:8), while the law exposes it. The forgiveness of God's grace enables the righteousness we desire and imparts to us Christ's love, not only changing our behavior, but also our hearts, so that we obey whole-heartedly.\r\n<blockquote>\"Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little\" (Luke 7:47).</blockquote>\r\nSo God does not condemn, judge, criticize, punish, or scare us, for these have all been given and finished in Christ's crucifixion. Grace will produce joy and peace, drawing you close to God casting out all fear.\r\n\r\n<b>He Convicts Us of Righteousness</b>\r\nThere is an argument that the Holy Spirit teaches us our sin. This verse it usually taken out of context:\r\n<blockquote>\"And He, when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin...\"</blockquote>\r\nBut, the verse goes on to show who the Holy Spirit convicts of sin.\r\n<blockquote>\"and righteousness and judgment; 9 concerning sin, <b>because they do not believe in Me;</b> 10 and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer see Me; 11 and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged\" (John 16:8-11).</blockquote>\r\nWe are no longer of the world, because we believe.\r\n<blockquote>\"If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world\" (John 15:19).</blockquote>\r\nTo those who don't believe In Jesus, he exposes their Sin (a noun) so they are convicted of their need for forgiveness and a Savior, because unless they have been forgiven, their sins are still held against them. But, to us believers, who have already received the remission of our sins and our Savior, he shows us our righteousness, the righteousness that comes as a gift from God through Christ and is not merited from our works.\r\n<blockquote>\"and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer see Me\" (John 16:10).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, so that we may be justified by faith. 25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor\" (Galatians 3:23-25).</blockquote>\r\nBecause Jesus himself is not longer with us to teach us our righteousness we have something even better, the spirit who will convict us 'concerning righteousness'. Have you realized how easy it is to forget who God has made you? Amidst all the teachings, society, your many mistakes, it's easy to forget that God actually made you righteous. The Holy Spirit was sent to teach you and remind you of your righteousness. He teaches the things that God's has freely given you.\r\n<blockquote>\"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God\" (1 Corinthians 2:12).</blockquote>\r\nWhat has he freely given us? Righteousness, holiness, perfection, cleanliness, grace, every blessing, communion with God, forgiveness, etc...\r\n<blockquote>\"how much more will those who receive God's abundant <b>provision of grace</b> and of the <b>gift of righteousness</b> reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ\" (Romans 5:17).</blockquote>\r\nRighteousness is a gift and the Holy Spirit tells you about this gift God has given you. And when we know that we are righteous, that righteousness exerts its influence over our desires, will, and behavior causing us to express it.\r\n\r\n<b>Changing our Mentality</b>\r\nSo then, what is the consequence in our behavior and thinking as our minds are renewed into living under grace instead of law? There are so many it would be impossible to describe them all. The one I most wish to emphasize is how we are not to go through life living in the consciousness of sin but rather in the consciousness of love. Always being aware of what you are doing wrong or what you have done wrong brings guilt and condemnation. It can lead to sickness and despair. The knowledge of sin is addictive. You never have enough of it. You are constantly wondering, what should I be doing? What's wrong with me? How can I fix it if I don't know its there. But, the awareness of love brings contentment and peace. It produces joy, life, and health and brings good works. God's forgiveness and love takes away the awareness of sin and when you spend time in His presence, you will find yourself forgetting your sin just as He does. The second consequence I want to emphasize is how we begin to trust in the work of the spirit to change our behavior without worrying about it and forsaking our forgiveness.\r\n<blockquote>“But <b>if, in seeking to be justified in Christ, we Jews find ourselves also among the sinners, doesn’t that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!</b> 18 If I rebuild what I destroyed, then I really would be a lawbreaker.\r\n19 “For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. 20 I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 21 <b>I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!</b>” (Galatians 2:17-21). Later he says, \"<b>For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope</b>\" (Galatians 5:5).</blockquote>\r\nPaul is saying, if while we are receiving our righteousness through faith and not through the law we find sin in our lives, does that mean that Christ promotes sin? Not at all. Paul's response in those instances is then to say that we are not to lay aside the grace of God, reverting back to the condemnation and punishments of the law because it cannot impart righteousness. Instead, he says the spirit imparts our righteousness and we shall patiently wait for it. The spirit is a powerful motivator and we need to respect his ability to change us rather than forsake our forgiveness and righteousness to get some puny act together. Will you sell Christ's work for you own? Will you lay aside his righteousness to you to create your own. Then don't revert to condemnation, guilt, and punishment to train yourself in godliness but rather entrust yourself and submit to his grace. Don't give room for your pride and refuse to accept the love of Christ. (James 4:6)\r\n<blockquote>\"11 For the <b>grace</b> of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. 12 It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age\" (Titus 2:11-12).</blockquote>\r\nIt is from grace that comes the power to live upright, self-controlled, and godly lives. So instead, we switch our mentality from sin-consciousness through the law to love-consciousness through grace. But the law mentality does not only include the ten commandments, but human ordinances and practices. There are hundreds of conflicting social rules and ideas on how to act. Rules governing body language, courtesy, and appearance. These rules can be good, but they can also bring worry and wondering. It may cause you worry about which behaviors to choose, what rules you are breaking instead of resting in God's love for you. In these cases, instead of scrutinizing ourselves, we need to trust the power of the spirit to produce his rightful behaviors in us and move our eyes to Jesus. We are to live in the awareness of his love, without worrying about the opinion of man. In summary, if you want grace to change your life, then let it change your life. If you want to learn how to love, you must learn to let yourself be loved.",

              "wp:comment_content": "Hmm Chuck, on tithing I agree with Prince. He's not like Louie Giglio complaining how everyone's super rich compared to the Africans and then shames his church into giving. Prince told his church to try tithing as a way to let go on their own efforts to earn money. It actually cures many Singaporeans from financial fear if they will just throw away a few bucks and depend on the Lord.\r\n\r\nI don't believe Joseph Prince for everything either. He can be a very convenient dodger sometimes. He convinced people to read \"the narrow and wide gate\" in the context of this life only without any Hebrew semantic dissection. Few years ago he said that he predicted Fukushima contamination from the Bible using some word from the psalms reflecting the Asia region that had something to do with nuclear stuff-and my acquaintance searched the original word and there was nothing nuclear there at all. Just two weeks ago he was pointing his fingers at his church saying \"don't condemn the law preachers-they're saved too\". Fancy that when he is the one that should be reflecting on his teachings, having used the law preachers to fill the gap in Matthew 7:21. He preaches on healing by faith and yet complains that \"people want healing before they hear the message\" which obviously is a bit like reverse legalism since it pressures people to treat the gospel like lectures. When he sells his materials on wisdom he goes Solomon style \"wisdom is supreme-pray for wisdom above all else\" and when he'selling tongues CDs he goes \"pray for tongues first-they open all other gifts\".\r\n\r\nBut point is, grace preachers aren't always graceful, but it's natural since Law preachers more often aren't fully into law either. It's just a common lapse we're all prone to making. I may not do better if I preached  personally. Who knows? You don't often see law preachers saying \"be prepared for torture when the Beast arrives-if you put on his mark there's salvation lost for you\" even though their doctrine would expect it.\r\n\r\nTo be honest Joseph Prince is a relatively honest guy. I'd say 85-95% trustworthy scripturally. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm personally concerned about is the \"If saved always saved\" bunch who pretend to be the \"once saved always saved\" bunch. Those guys sneak in pretending to be grace preachers but give people a nightmare.",

You have to keep in mind that I cannot update pages on every whim that comes, because I am in college.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure I understand your argument. Are you saying today the law is still for christians, that we are meant to be under both law and grace?\r\n\r\nI believe Paul upheld the law for it's purpose, to bring us to Christ. How? By showing us our sinfulness and need for him. But now that we have come to Christ, the law is no longer our tutor and in fact continuing to live under it after being saved is not only unproductive, it is deadly. The book of Galatians, Hebrews, and Romans all address this concept, Galatians especially. As for Jesus upholding the law, you need to understand the purpose for which he did it. It was not to bring salvation, but to demonstrate how short we've come to meeting his standards for eternal life through works. \r\n\r\nDid I understand you correct?",

          "content:encoded": "<p>I'm not talking about the juice and bread of communion, but intimate relating to God Himself. Have you ever had a time when you were certain you had heard God's voice? When his peace flooded over you? When you sensed His presence filling your body? When you were filled with awe at His grander? This communion we have with God is our birthright as his children. The best part is, we don't have to wait till we die to experience Him. God is here with us today. Leviticus 26:12 says, \"I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people.\" In God's temple in Jerusalem, his presence rested in the holy place behind the curtain, and only once a year was it allowed to be visited and only under extreme conditions. But, now Jesus has perfected us and opened the way so that we might enter into the most holy of holies and experience his living presence.</p><blockquote><b>Hebrews 10</b> \"19 Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, 20 by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, 21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 22 let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. 23 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.\"</blockquote><p>What does this mean? It means that Jesus has made us right with God so that we might no longer fear judgement and condemnation, but draw close to God having our guilt removed and enjoying his presence. God's presence is no longer reserved for the elite once a year. It's for all his children and is always and continually available. God has no reason to withdraw from his children or hide Himself from them. But, He beckons you to draw near in full assurance. Full assurance that you are loved, delighted in, favored, righteous, and blameless.</p><blockquote>2 Corinthians 13:14 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. 1 John 1:3 \"And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.\"</blockquote><p>If we may truly experience God, enjoy his presence, talk with Him, feel his peace and delight, and have fellowship with Him, let's not ignore our privilege for human arguments and philosophy that questions the validity of spiritual experiences. What I mean is this, why should we listen to and give credit to arguments that God no longer speaks today, or that He only speaks through the Bible, or messages that try to avoid spiritual experiences because they are dangerous? I agree that spiritual experiences require discernment and must line up with the Bible, but let us provide a culture that encourages God experiences rather than discourage them. Out of these experiences come the greatest life changes, deep love for God, incredible encouragement, and produce good fruit. The world doesn't accept the validity of fellowship with God through the spirit. To them it is foolishness. Consider this passage in 1 Corinthians 2:</p><blockquote><b>God’s Wisdom Revealed by the Spirit</b> <br />6 We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. 7 No, we declare God’s wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. 8 None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 9 However, as it is written:<blockquote>“What no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human mind has conceived”[b]— the things God has prepared for those who love him—</blockquote>10 these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 11 For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 12 What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. 13 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words.[c] 14 The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. 15 The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, 16 for,<blockquote>“Who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?”[d]</blockquote>But we have the mind of Christ.</blockquote><p>Remember, even Paul's message was not revealed to him by humans, but by God himself. He writes in Galatians 1:11-12 \"I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin; for I did not receive it from a human source, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.\" You see, it is the spirit that explains what God has given us, prepared for us. In John, we learn that the spirit also teaches, encourages, and comforts us. If these then all come through the spirit, let us not consider them foolishness. When we experience God, we must be willing to set aside that critical, judgement, and doubting spirit in our minds and be prepared to accept a greater wisdom than our own. Afterall, even discernment, which is so vital to hearing God's voice, is not a fleshly or methodical approach, but rather also comes through the spirit. So not only is the voice of God given through the spirit, but the discernment of that voice also comes through the spirit. Shall we then take spiritual things and judge them with earthly things? Shall we critique the spirit with the flesh or subject the voice of God to human reasoning? I'm not saying we should throw these out all together, there is a time for simply hearing God and there is a time for discernment, and to use the Bible as the foundation. This requires a new practice and grace. A practice to hear the voice of God, experience his presence, and discern his voice and a grace to sometimes make mistakes and get it wrong. Even the best prophets sometimes hear God wrong, therefore we must all be given grace to hear his voice wrong. And in this grace, we should practice and grow in hearing and understanding his voice using the scripture as our guide, because God does speak today. It does get easier and better to hear Him over time and is well worth the effort. Don't procrastinate in fellowship with God like so many people do, serving and serving and serving God, but never knowing the God they serve. Such people miss out on the greatest experiences of their lives. If you want to begin experiencing God, or to do so more, you don't have to give a great effort of will. Simply ask. Ask to talk to Him, He is there and He will converse. Just be willing to lay aside that critical part of your mind for a time and have the faith of a child.</p>",

          "content:encoded": "I'm going to attempt to share something online that is somewhat personal and could potentially be offensive, but on the flip side could be very potent and life-giving. I believe God speaks to us today and I am going to release one of my conversations with Him, one that addresses you! If you object to something I say, please be gentle about it since I am in a humble place with sharing this. I do not mean to be proud or claim to hear God perfectly accurately if it may be not.\r\n\r\n(This is what I felt like the Lord was saying. It may not all be Him, I may have heard some things incorrectly. So if you will, give me grace for hearing incorrectly and use discernment as you read this for your own sake. Words without quotations are my words. Words with \"quotations\" are God's words. God bless!)\r\n\r\nContext: (I had read a few of my conversations with the Lord to people and 3 of them encouraged me to turn it into a book. As I was pondering it, I came across the question... If these are God's words, is it ok to edit them? Or should I just leave everything raw.)\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So you think I should just edit these conversations?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Unless you want to share everything with the world. When you are writing to the world, remember you are not writing to Me. The world will not like everything you say, but if they are reading your book, then they will have an open mind. That being said, I can start a new series of conversations for you called conversations for the world.”</span></span></span>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">O God!

Some of these conversations are in context and in order for a reason.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind while you read that even though I often hear God's voice, occasionally I mishear or unintentionally discern one of my own thoughts as being from Him. I just ask God a question and pretty much write down whatever comes to mind. So just as I do, use discernment and give me grace to make mistakes while you read! Thanks. O! And be gentle with the comments, this is a fairly humble and vulnerable position for me.\r\n\r\nIn using discernment, one of the ways the Holy Spirit speaks is by giving us peace about a certain topic. If you are reading this and you feel troubled or you are not finding peace, reject it, no matter how smooth it may be.\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><b>If God is sovereign, why is their pain?</b></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Here is a popular question I can imagine many people asking.

Because those children make choices apart from the will of the father. Being Lord of all does not mean I get my will all the time. I promise life, and I fulfill that. And as you have realized, my promises don't end there, I have promised to bless you in every way. But the blessings I give you here pale compared to the blessings I will give you in eternity.”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So why can you not get your will all the time?</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Because I need people who desire my will.

The world learns through mistakes, but you learn from My Wisdom. To make pain equal with God is folly. I do not take pleasure in the suffering of my children.

Somethings written here are in context and need to be understood like that.

Man has limited the reasons why I may speak. They feel their voice is better than God's. They encourage you to ignore my words and to listen to conventional human wisdom. The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him. This is why it seems hard to hear my voice. Because it is not popular. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and become united to his wife, and the two will be one flesh. You are united with me in spirit, but you must come out of the doctrines and wisdom of the world if you are to pursue my theology. Your “parents” represent the basic principles of the world. The spirit does not operate by the basic principles of the world, in him is heavenly wisdom. If you are to believe the things I teach and say, you must have your mind renewed and open to my words. The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment. What this passage is saying is that to operate in heavenly wisdom you must have discernment, to judge what is of God and what is of man. And let no man tell you otherwise.“</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So are you saying you are always speaking we just must learn to pay attention and accept your truth?</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I am always speaking yes.

          "content:encoded": "<h1>Conversations with God</h1>\r\nI'm going to attempt to share something personal and possibly offensive, but on the flip side could be very encouraging and life-giving. I believe God speaks to us today, and I have decided to share one of my conversations with him to the public. This puts me in a very humble place. Who am I to say what God is saying?\r\n\r\nBut I ask you to weight and test the things I announce as coming from God. Basically I sit down at my computer, ask God a question, and type almost whatever I hear. This means some of the thoughts may be my own. I try to use discernment and much of the time I do hear God's voice. On occasion however, I can mishear something. So use discernment and give me grace to have heard incorrectly. Otherwise, be encouraged! O! And be gentle in the comments please, I am in a humble position.\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<h2>The Knowledge of Good and Evil</h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_150\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\" class=\" \"]<a href=\"http://revelationsingrace.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/montana-363.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-150\" src=\"http://revelationsingrace.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/montana-363.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"Lower Falls at Yellow Stone National Forest\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> Lower Falls at Yellow Stone National Forest[/caption]\r\n\r\nLord, you've spoken a lot to me about this subject, but how would you speak to someone who's never heard this message?\r\n\r\n“I would tell them that the knowledge of good and evil is not good for man to eat. They would ask, what is the knowledge of good and evil. And I would tell them this. It is the awareness of your sin, the message of shame. It is the law in all its convicting power.”\r\n\r\nWhat does that look like practically? How do I know if I'm listening to the knowledge of good and evil or you?\r\n\r\n“The spirit will guide you into all truth. But the message of the law and prophets is according to that knowledge. The message of the wrath of God poured out on sinners is that message. The message of shame is that message. The message of pain and suffering is that message. If it subtracts from the righteousness of Christ, then it is the message of shame. You will know it by its fruit. It takes my children's confidence and turns their hearts to lead. They cannot serve me under that knowledge. They are doing themselves ill. The message of shame is the message of death and condemnation.”\r\n<blockquote>\"If it subtracts from the righteousness of Christ, then it is the message of shame.\"</blockquote>\r\nGod, how do we live without that knowledge?\r\n\r\n“Very simply, in the love and provision of your Father, no longer in the awareness of your sin.”\r\n\r\nThen how do you correct your children without the awareness of sin?\r\n\r\n“Love keeps no record of wrongs. A sinful behavior may be changed, but it is not credited to your account. If you want to live perfect, then be merciful as your heavenly father is merciful.\"\r\n<blockquote>\"If you want to live perfect, then be merciful as your heavenly father is merciful.\"</blockquote>\r\nHelp me to see the difference between correction and the knowledge of good and evil.\r\n\r\n“Correction must be mixed with the grace of God. If you try to live righteously under the law, your efforts will fail. The law does not make anyone righteous but holds everyone accountable to God.”\r\n<blockquote>\"Correction must be mixed with the grace of God.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhat happens when a believer is trying to become more righteous?\r\n\r\n“I suppose you're meaning in his actions? Holy Living? In grace he will succeed every time. But apart from Me he can do nothing.”\r\n\r\nSo then how do we approach becoming better people?\r\n\r\n“Your heart must be established in the grace of God. Do not think I was joking when I said apart from Me you can do nothing. Man's efforts to redeem himself always backfire. Maturity can not come from the will and effort of man. If they could be achieved, Christ died for nothing.”\r\n\r\nYou say man's efforts cannot succeed? Are you suggesting we should give up on our efforts to live holy?\r\n\r\n“Who makes you holy?”\r\n\r\nYou do.\r\n\r\n“If you are trusting in my efforts then you will lay aside your efforts. Your conscience feels comfortable and secure if you are taking effort to fix yourself, but my grace is established in rest, not in striving.”\r\n<blockquote>\"Your conscience feels comfortable and secure if you are taking effort to fix yourself, but my grace is established in rest, not in striving.”</blockquote>\r\nSo we should just rest and let you fix us?\r\n\r\n“Let my goodness lead you to repentance. When you are sick where do you go?”\r\n\r\nTo the hospital!\r\n\r\n“Sin is like a sickness, and only my love can cure it. Your conscience and all its guilt cannot cure that sickness. No matter how hard you will, you cannot will away that sickness. Sickness is taken away with the proper care and treatment. Unless you rest, your body will not recover.”\r\n\r\nSo we really should rest... and look to you and your love for us.\r\n\r\n“It is not until you receive the gift of no condemnation that you will be able to walk free of your sin. I am not advocating sin. This is not a license to practice immorality, it is a license to be loved unconditionally. And my love will take all roots of sin out of your life.”\r\n<blockquote>“It is not until you receive the gift of no condemnation that you will be able to walk free of your sin. This is not a license to practice immorality, it is a license to be loved unconditionally.\"</blockquote>\r\nSo what shall I do when I find a sinful habit in my life?\r\n\r\n“Where do sinful habits come from?”\r\n\r\nI have no idea...\r\n\r\n“Identity theft.”\r\n\r\nHuh?\r\n\r\n“You have been made forever righteousness by the work of my son, when you know that, it stops the power of sin in your life.”\r\n\r\nSo your saying those patterns emerge from me not believing that you made me righteousness.\r\n\r\n“As long as you think you've earned your righteousness, you will also think you can loose it. So when you find patterns of sin in your life, instead of falling into terror and worrying about the next time you will commit the sin, let your mind be renewed in the grace of God, letting him convict you of righteousness and bring out that fruit in your life.”\r\n<blockquote>“As long as you think you've earned your righteousness, you will also think you can loose it.\"</blockquote>\r\nSo I should be convicted of righteousness while I'm sinning? That seems backwards!\r\n\r\n“Where does sin come from?”\r\n\r\nDoes it really come from identity theft? Couldn't it come from me just not trying hard enough or me living in rebellion?\r\n\r\n“Trying is not succeeding. And rebellion is not covered in this lesson. Yes Jon Paul, sin really does come from identity theft. As long as you let the enemy tell you who you are, you behave in that same manner.”\r\n\r\nSo our living comes out of our identity?\r\n\r\n“The righteous shall live by faith.”\r\n\r\nSo we fail because we've forgotten that we are righteous.\r\n\r\n“Remember Lion King? Simba was falsely accused and believed the lie. That stole his identity from him and he lived as an outsider though he was really the king. In the same way, when one of my children gives into the liar and forgets his place in my kingdom, righteousness becomes unworthy of him (in his mind). When his mind is renewed to the truth or his kingship or position in my kingdom, he takes back the ground he lost! Focusing on the sin is not the root of the problem, and it only makes things worse. When identify is restored, his actions will follow.”\r\n\r\nWhy are actions tied to identity?\r\n\r\n“Identity is the description of how you function. The knowledge of sin brings a false identity to believers.”\r\n\r\nDo you think its good to be convicted of sin?\r\n\r\n“When you convict a person of sin, you stop the growth of righteousness in their life. It produces the exact opposite fruit of what was intended. That is the nature of the law. It brings wrath, not salvation. When you convict a believer of sin, you are destroying their confidence and faith in God, that he justifies the ungodly. You must realize that God will by no means remember or recall their sins.\"\r\n\r\nThen how do we train others to behave appropriately?\r\n\r\n“In identity, in faith, in grace. In patience and hope. Don't give up on your redeemer.”\r\n\r\nThe scripture confirms that. It says, 'If, while we seek to be justified in Christ, it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners, does that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not! ...I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!' Its saying that if we find sin in our lives, we should not revert back to the law to fix it, but hold faithfully to grace!\r\n\r\n“That's very good! Who taught you that?”\r\n\r\nYour spirit did!\r\n\r\n“I give you the credit for accepting it. I am very proud of you! Take that and apply it to areas of weakness in your life. When you sin, do you revert back to judgement and condemnation to fix those things, or do you still consider yourself righteous and forgiven because of what Christ has done?”\r\n\r\nI believe that's true, but it seems arrogant. Who am I to believe I am righteous after I sin?\r\n\r\n“Who are you not to? Your sin does not make you righteous, my work does. When you believe you are righteous you are honoring me, when you revert to the law you are honoring yourself and worshiping your sin. If you want sin to loose dominion over you, you must revert to grace and not the law for edification. The strength of sin is the law. It is not a trick verse. Sin becomes powerful in your life when you are under condemnation. Reject it, standing firm in the grace of God, and do not let a man nor anything created tell you otherwise. It is my grace that justifies not your efforts.”\r\n<blockquote>\"If you want sin to loose dominion over you, you must revert to grace and not the law for edification. Sin becomes powerful in your life when you are under condemnation.\"</blockquote>\r\nMy conscience doesn't always agree with that.\r\n\r\n“Your conscience is part of your mind and can be renewed. I feel like this topic is appropriately addressed.”\r\n\r\n“Your conscience is part of your mind and can be renewed.\"\r\n\r\nMe too. Thanks God! You're awesome! I love you so much!\r\n\r\n“My grace to you! Be happy loved one! You are highly favored in the Beloved.”\r\n\r\nWhy do you have all these conversations with me?\r\n\r\n“The same reason why you have them with Me.”",

I'm really glad it encouraged you! \r\n\r\nIts also very easy for me to convict myself or at least let my conscience convict me of guilt and sin instead of believing I'm righteous. Every fiber of my consciousness rebels. It wants to feel pure and justified because I had power in myself to do what was right. I doesn't understand what it means to be freely given that. That's why I felt the Lord was saying that the conscience can and needs to be renewed. So, I am there with you. I have to train the members of my body to accept the free gift of righteousness through the power of the spirit and the message of grace.\r\n\r\nBut isn't that refreshing? Now I know it is not appropriate to waddle in condemnation, especially if I'm wanting to improve my behavior. Whether it feels right or strange, if I want my behavior to improve, I must relax and receive his goodness!",

No matter how hard you will, you cannot will away that sickness. Sickness is taken away with the proper care and treatment. Unless you rest, your body will not recover.\"\r\n\r\nI had to pause and read it over a few times. (A good thing, I assure you). The truth of this statement spoke to me in a way that I hadn't encountered in a while, seeing that we cannot recover unless we allow God to help us, and only He can cure us. So often we live with the overwhelming burden of guilt when we don't have to at all. Love this piece.",

          "content:encoded": "Here is another popular question or subject in the church. Is the Believer still under generational curse? There are many programs devoted to removing generation curse and inner healing. And some produce genuine testimonies. I think that God can use this ministry according to the faith of those in, however, I don't think it is God's best for us. I am throughly convinced that the believer is no longer under generational curse. Here is a blog on the subject. <a href=\"http://thegospelofgrace.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/the-new-creation-cannot-be-under-generational-curse/\">The New Creation CANNOT be under Generational Curse</a>.  I would highly recommend reading this article, it carefully explains it. However, I would add that we are not only free from generational curse, but we are free completely from the curse of the law, our sins, or any malicious things the enemy or someone might speak over us.\r\n<blockquote>\"Like a flitting sparrow or a fluttering swallow, an undeserved curse goes nowhere\" (Proverbs 26:2).</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: 'Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.'\r\n\r\nHe redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit\" (Galatians 3:13).</blockquote>\r\nAccording to the New Testament, now that we are righteous by faith, no curse is deserved, even when we sin. I hear a lot of talks about how this sin or that sin opened up the door for the enemy to work in their life and there are a lot of ministries that work on shutting doors your sin might have opened.\r\n\r\nRevelation 3:7 says,\r\n<blockquote>\"What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.\"</blockquote>\r\nAre you a \"one?\" If God, through his son has shut the door to curses on your life and has opened a door to blessings, you, being a \"one\" cannot open it again, or shut the door to blessings.\r\n<blockquote>\"the one who was born of God keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot harm him\" (1 John 5:18).</blockquote>\r\nI'm not against deliverance ministries. There are some people who see some healing in them. I however left more discouraged and broken and paranoid than I came in with. I bet God works with us where we are at, in their level of faith. But I do not believe it is the perfect form. Sometimes, we make it seem like the enemy is more powerful in the believers life than God is. People switch their focus off of God and onto fighting the enemy, who is already defeated! They attribute the bad things that happen in their life to some kind of curse or open door. But, if you truely want to resist the enemy, that is not how you do it. The scripture says,<em id=\"__mceDel\" style=\"font-size:1rem;line-height:1;\"></em>\r\n<blockquote>\"Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings\" (1 Peter 5:9).</blockquote>\r\nTo resist the enemy, you don't fight him, you stand firm in your faith. You keep your eyes on God and He will fight your battles for you. He has already defeated the power of the enemy on your life. If you continue to fight the enemy you are still believing he has power! Don't be quoting scriptures against the enemy that he has no power while the very motive for you doing so is believing he has power! Eventually you'll talk yourself out of it! Of course, if it helps your confidence and faith remember those scriptures. But realize, that the enemy cannot touch your life. I used to be worried and fearful of demons or any teaching related to it. I was so paranoid, I couldn't function properly in public and my parents eventually talked to me about it. It is so important that you understand that the enemy doesn't have power or permission to work in the believer's life. Bad things may happen, but don't always attribute that to the enemy or a curse. I suppose you can think of it that way if you want, no evil thing comes from God. But I once had a pastor say, \"You know, when my water heater goes out. I don't start rebuking the enemy and casting him out, I call the plumber.\"\r\n\r\nThe primary way the enemy tries to discourage the believer is through inspiring others who are under his control to persecute you for your beliefs. That's why the apostles faced such persecution and he tells them to hold fast, because others are enduring the same kinds of persecutions. The enemy's primary goal is not to cause you to sin. It only takes one to make you guilty of all, but also all your sins are forgiven! He achieves near nothing from that. His primary role is to convince you that you are not forgiven, not under God's favor and grace, and have somehow lost your salvation or righteousness. He wants you to put your eyes on yourself. He uses the law to bring condemnation on you. That is why you must stand firm in your faith. Not faith that you've done enough good. Faith that you've been forgiven enough! Faith says, \"God has made me righteous forever by his son, and there is no condemnation for my sins.\"\r\n<blockquote>\"And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness\" (2 Corinthians 11:14-15).\r\n\r\n\"See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross. And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross\" (Colossians 2 scattered).</blockquote>\r\nGod took away the weapon of the enemy, which is the \"written code, with its regulations.\" The enemy is a minister of righteousness not of sin. But he uses righteousness to condemn you not to impart it too you. Of course, by tangling the believer up under the law, the result is more sin. But his goal is to make you feel condemned through how others falsely say all kinds of evil against you and persecute you. Imagine these disciples, teaching the grace of God and having Jews come up and rebuke and persecute them for teaching against the law of Moses. The Jews were coming to minister \"righteousness\" and condemn the disciples' faith. That is why they must hold firm to their faith, even when it causes that trouble. Peter is saying to take comfort in the fact that others are enduing the same kinds of trials.\r\n\r\nSo anyways, that is my rant on curses. I hope you were encouraged. My goal is that you become settled in your mind that no curse that God has not given shall overtake you. And under Christ, God will not ever curse you either. Be confident and expect his favor and blessings. For with the same token that he said Christ took your curse, he also said so that the blessings of Abraham might be guaranteed.

He states that he used to have the old school approach to deliverance (i.e. talking to demons and acting as an exorcist) but realized that Scripture tells New Covenant believers to resist the devil. Now he teaches people who they are in Christ. \r\n\r\nJesus delivered us from THE curse and sin (singular) so I don't think it wise for a believer to dig up individual sins and curses and try uncover every stone of the past.",

The knowledge of sin is addictive, you never have enough of it. It makes you think, \"O no! What if there's more! How will I fix it if I don't know?\" You get on a constant search of morbid introspection and leaving your faith and focus on God behind. It produces worry, fear, useless rituals, paranoia. Like I said, I couldn't function properly in public. But, God fixes all those things behind the scenes, I just focus on Him and let his grace fill my life and all those problems go away!",

My friend had a sister on the choir and prayer group who was possessed in front of many people, and she said the demon entered her because of \"bad music\" and didn't explain further. I have also heard of many Christians who got possessed by the kundalini spirit. Is it possible for the Holy Spirit to live inside you and yet still be possessed by demons?\r\n\r\nAlso my other Christian friend reported many Christians who've woken up with sleep paralysis finding demons standing at the foot of their bed. They ordered them out by Christ but the incidents still seemed to shake them more than the demons. I asked another friend and he says it's true and mostly happens to Koreans. There's even reports of demons being able to touch and pull these people. The ones that still live to tell the story say they've remembered to say Christ's name. I wonder what happens if they don't remember to cry out the name.\r\n\r\nI'm not very interested in other testimonies of spiritual warfare, and I don't fancy the tiring nature of its proponents watching out for hexed Asian ornaments and so forth, but demon harassment and possession I wonder if you can ask God about it someday in the far future when you are bored and free, since they come from the testimonies not of strangers but of 3 very trustworthy friends of mine.",

              "wp:comment_content": "Hahahahaha, I totally know what you mean. I grew up in that environment too! \"who claims to specialize in possessions, demonic presence, legal rights of demons, personal responsibility in removing curses, or falling under hexes from occult objects, .\" I did used to believe these things and they used to terrify me. I also once thought I had a demon. I went to a deliverance center to get it cast out and screamed and thought I saw a dragon. For months I was terrified at the thought of getting another one. I wouldn't go around people or to certain places because I thought that certain places would infect me with demons and that if other people coughed around me the demons that were in them would get onto me. My goodness! I stopped functioning normally and the people around me became concerned. I no longer fear these things. No, I absolutely believe no christian can be infected with a demon. There is no instance of it in the Bible. As for the stories? Well, I definitely believed I had had a legitimate story, but now I realize it was my own imaginations. In fact, I was better off before I listened to these kind of teachings. It's remarkable how real some of these stories seem, but I don't believe them. I believe those messages alter our perceptions and end up creating experiences like these. \r\n\r\n\r\nBut, these spiritual warfare ideas are not biblical. There is no instance of a christian in the bible having a demon. Those two people in Acts who were trying to cast a demon out were not christians. The demon said, \"Paul I know, but who are you?\" I believe he knew Paul because Paul was God's child. These men saw the miracles Paul was doing and tried to repeat them using Jesus's name. But because they didn't believe in Jesus it didn't work for them. \r\n\r\nDemon's have no legal right in the believers life. Corinthians tells us he has disarmed the principalities and powers. No, we cannot open doors to them.\" What God has sealed with the death and resurrection of his son cannot be undone by an idle word. \"A door the Lord shuts no man can open, and a door the Lord opens no man can shut.\" There is no curse, Christ redeemed us from the curse as Galatians tells us. You will never find any instances of items infecting people with curses in the new testament. Paul was even brave enough to eat foods that were sacrificed to idols if they did not bother other people's conscience.\r\n\r\nThese teachings are unbiblical, unhealthy, and dangerous. They destroy lives and do not produce the fruit of the kingdom. But, our church has stopped pursuing these things, probably because we've realized they are unbiblical.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I have talked to the Lord about it. I believe the Lord has told me that demons want nothing to do with Christians, they are afraid of them. They will flee wherever you go!",

          "content:encoded": "As the Lord was opening up the door for me to hear his voice continually we had this conversation early on where I gave him my complaints and struggled with the question, 'how do I know if it's God speaking to me?' You know the best person to ask such a question to is God. I want to encourage you to ask God questions like this and to talk to Him yourself if you don't already. Hearing God's voice is not a gift given only to the elite, its given to all christians or any who would ask. There are a couple references to stories and things He told me prior to this conversation. That I can share later. But I'm skipping the first part of the conversation because of personal content, so you will be dropping in right in the middle.\r\n\r\n(Again, with all my other conversations with God, I often hear God's voice correctly but many times I mishear, so please use discernment as you read and give me grace to hear him incorrectly at times. I wouldn't dare post a blog like this if I didn't have that grace. Be encouraged and if you disagree with a point, please be gentle in your comments. I'm in a humble position.)\r\n<h2>How Do I Know its God</h2>\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I want it to be real.

Then I'll move on to next week's lotto numbers. I must be a crazy man to try these stunts, but better crazy than powerless. I hate the shame of powerlessness. I want to be powerful and do miracles through God, be it any kind possible. I remember being filled with the spirit before with a supernatural faith and love-and I tried to move the mountain near my home but failed. To this day I still wonder why I didn't manage. My faith was supernaturally strong then and I still couldn't move a spoon off a table. It makes me wonder even more how strong Jesus' faith is.  I miss the manifestation of his presence though. I'd trade all 7 biblical gifts for that 1 thing if I could have it for the rest of my life. But why? He's there for a few seconds and he goes even they I cry don't go.\r\n\r\nI don't like to look at the occult people with all their supernatural powers and money flowing in like a flood and be the typical sobbing Christian stressed out by poorness and trouble in the corner. Our kind shouldn't have to live like this. No Christian should have to squeal when an occultists play with a ouija board when Paul struck the sorcerer blind. No Christian should have to go without prophecy when the occultists endulge in their remote viewing and other powers. No Christian should be poor when occultists have money flowing in like a flood. No Christian should be beaten by their enemies while occultists put a curse and watch theirs squeal in defeat. I know I am not a Christian because of power, and I will not judge Christians because of their powerlessness, but nevertheless I will strive to attain it. One day I will overpower the occult. One day I will make the occultists look with envy unto me and my God. One day I will repay you sevenfold.\r\n\r\nI will practice speaking to God even if I do not hear him till I die. I know my wrath still burns against him when I fail, but better be raged in trying for greater things than be calm in settling for being poor, diseased, bored and uninformed. I shall be powerful. I will not be a pawn of a preacher, a number filler for a church, a helpless boy begging the great for their powers. I never want to be trampled like that again. \r\n\r\nThank you for teaching me. I am meditating on this post right now, taking down the major instructions. One day I will pay you back sevenfold. I don't know what I will master, but whatever I master, whatever mysteries of the universe I hear, whatever organ I can heal, I will come back and manifest that power on you. I hope it's not tongues though-having tongues without interpreters around is a pain in the neck.",

          "content:encoded": "This was a personal encounter I had with God one day. The same encounter I reference in my other blog entry, \"<a title=\"Conversations with God - How Do I Know I'm Hearing God's Voice\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/02/02/conversations-with-god-how-do-i-know-when-its-god-speaking/\" target=\"_blank\">Conversations with God - How Do I Know if I'm hearing God's Voice</a>.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been quite some time since I had heard God so clearly as that day. So I took the opportunity to test whether I was really hearing God or not. I had been packing for my trip to college and a bag of pencils had spilt on the ground. It was the first thing that grabbed my attention. I said, \"God, if this is you speaking to me, can you tell me how many pencils are on the ground?\" I then tried intently to listen and I heard, \"15, 12, 18, 7...\" I knew it was my imagination but I was frustrated that I couldn't tell which one was God.\r\n\r\nThen God spoke clearly to me and said, \"How many do you think there are?\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"15.\"\r\n\r\nGod said, \"Count them and I'll make up the difference.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't understand what he meant, but I counted the pencils and there were 10. Immediately I realized that the difference was 5 and I was reminded of a sermon by Joseph Prince I had listened to 2 days prior on how the number 5 in the Bible represents the letter for \"grace.\" From that, I realized what the Lord was saying. I heard his voice wrong, but his grace made up the difference! I was amazed and said, \"God! You did know how many pencils were on the ground!\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I knew, but you didn't need to know. What you needed to know is that my grace will cover you when you mishear my voice.\"\r\n\r\nSo don't be afraid to hear God's voice. Most of the time you will hear Him correctly, but sometimes every now and then we have heard his voice incorrectly. Don't let that discourage you however, because God's grace makes up the difference!",

          "content:encoded": "One day my brother and I were driving home from school. He said, \"I would really like to know how computer screens work. Like how the computer takes signals and turns them into pixels we can see.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"You should ask your professor.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I would but he's too busy. I wish there was an all knowing person you could ask anything to at any time...\"\r\n\r\nI looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"I know!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You should ask Him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe I will tonight before I go to bed. Maybe He'll teach me in a dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can ask him tonight, but I'm going to ask Him now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ok cool.\"\r\n\r\nSo I asked God how a computer screen works. He then gave me a simplified answer, \"There is a gas or liquid behind each pixel that changes color depending on how much electricity is flowing through it.\"\r\n\r\nI told that to Josh and he looked at me with astonished eyes! \"I think that's right.\" He then proceeded to look it up on google and I called my technological friend Basil to ask if it was correct. He said that it was. It was basically how a plasma screen worked. Further research confirmed it. It was simplified but true. So yea! God taught me how a plasma screen works. That inspired another series of conversations with Him. Because now I learned that He was a God of science who could teach me things about science. Until that time, I had never asked him questions like, how does the human body work? How do atoms work? What are the stars? I had been taught through school what to believe and had never asked the Creator of the Universe about it. Thus started some scientific conversations with Him. The first one I'm releasing is a conversation about emotions. Hope you enjoy.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPS: We can all talk to God like this. Everything I am saying to to inspire your relationship with Him and to encourage you to talk to Him more. :)",

They tell the body, this is pleasurable or this is troublesome to me. They are not directly linked to reasoning. I mature your feelings. Spending time with me will cause your emotions to mature. Emotions learn on an emotional level. They are trained by recognition and affirmation. Think of an emotion as an advanced perception encompassing intelligence, perception, and sense memory. Emotions are not always based on reason. Some are based on psychological events. For example, if one tastes pie for the first time and likes it. His sense memory will predict that effect the next time he encounters pie, and his emotions will prepare him for the sensation by giving him energy so he can better enjoy it. His emotions release higher sensations.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So your saying he will physically enjoy the pie more?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">The sensation will be stronger.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So we can elevate our senses by emotions?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Different kinds of sensors can be elevated by different emotions.

Thus, comfort is an emotional need to pain. The body is hurting, and emotional healing will speed the body's healing and calm the excessive sensitivity to the hurt. Comfort makes things seem alright. They tell the body everything is fine, there is no need to worry. The body will then stop sending sensitivity energies to that pain. So yes, in a sense comfort will dull the pain, if not remove it entirely. <b>Think of emotion as your body's flow of energy.</b> It gives directions on how energy is released, where that energy goes, and what kind of work it does.

This is why doing something for the first time is sometimes the hardest. Its also why you may loose emotional sensitivity to certain stimuli.

That's why joy is so relieving, it replaces stressful energies and causes the body to have tranquility. Sometimes joy will excite the body, giving it passion to motivate movement. But yes, emotions can release either stressful energy or pleasurable energy. Sometimes pleasurable energy can accomplish more work than stressful energy can. Stressful energy is effective and made for short periodical bursts. Extended energy comes from euphoria emotions. If the body stays in stressful energy for too long it can deplete the body's resources and the body will eventually run out of energy to give. Euphoria emotions have the opposite affect.

If you are in a heightened sense for too long of a time without significant change to the stimuli, the body will stop sending as much energy to the stimuli.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">What if the stimuli has significant change?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Then the emotions will either raise or relax accordingly.

Peace will train your body by recognition. It will cause your body to perceive your surroundings without high energy.

When you feel peaceful or joyful the body reorganizes itself into balance putting resources where they need to be in order to restore its health and vitality.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">And joy uses energy to reorganize the body?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Yes, kind of. Sometimes joy has to put energy into the body in order to balance it. Thus, if you've been experiencing a negative emotion for a long time, joy will release endorphins that heal, restore, and recover those energy levels.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">(When God says “Euphoria”, the current science term for it is “homeostasis”. God is actually referring to homeostasis in our language, but for some reason he calls its euphoria instead.)</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Homeostasis is when the body's needs are meet. In a state of homeostasis, the body will resume a calm, regenerative posture.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So define for me the confusion earlier.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">You asked if having critically low levels of energy can put you into a state of negative emotions. It can. But your body's default mode is restful and peaceful, it will always try to return to this state when it can. So to answer your question, it will enter those low energy negative emotions when it does not have energy to react to aggressive stimuli. So low energy does not necessarily mean bad emotions. It can mean that, if the body is trying to conserve energy. But at its lowest state, it will return to tranquility.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So do you call homeostasis euphoria?

What were you saying about how your emotions will assume a low energy state if a higher one is not needed?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">It does this to conserve energy.

That's why when you give yourself excessive joy for long periods of time, the effect tames down.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Thanks God.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">(Skip over this next part if it confuses you. I was thinking, well if joy restores energy, does there come a point where there is no more need for restoration when you body is stuffed with energy. If joy is a sensation of the body recharging (which is not completely correct), can the body get so full of energy that you can no longer experience joy? What God showed me was that both the sensation of recharging and the sensation of being fully recharged or homeostasis are positive sensations. He also told me that the body will try to balance its use of creating and using energy so they are equal. It does not want to create more energy than it will use or less energy. Also, when the body has an excessive amounts of energy that aren't being used, it will use that energy to upgrade the body in special ways.)</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Sometimes your body can produce excessive energy as when your metabolism speeds up.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Why does it do that?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">To permanently increase its overall store of energy.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So when joy has fully recharged my body, it will also increase its capacity?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">You can never run out of feeling joy.

Don't worry about discernment now, use it later. The emotion of joy is a powerful energy. Joy in the body reacts to many stimuli. One such producer is health. Joy trains the body to work effectively. The emotion of joy is different from the emotion of fear in this. Fear uses a short burst of energy that taxes all other energies, all other chemicals. Joy gives energy that combines with other chemicals to strengthen them. So joy is reinforcing the other chemicals in the body making them more productive. The more of this chemical in the body, the happier you will feel. When your body is low on joy, it starts to feel strained, this is because the chemicals its producing can't keep up with the demand. When the body is low on joy, it cannot continue to produce other chemicals fast enough for their use. Thus the body becomes tired and feel agitated. Joy re-stimulates the production of endorphins which give the body energy to function. Think of it this way. You have several buckets of water all going to different places to do work. Joy is like the hose that fills up the buckets. Without joy, the buckets run low on energy and that lack of energy leads to tiredness, and low energy negative emotions.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So with the bucket picture, what does fear do?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Fear pokes a hole in the buckets to consume energy faster, they tell those energies to use up energy faster, yet it doesn't refill them.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Thankyou, please continue.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Fear is not an energy, adrenaline is a combination of other chemicals, taken in excess of the supply given.

Sadness will teach your body peace. When you are sad you body is reordering its use of energy and finding new ways to conserve energy from being wasted. Too much sadness can stun the body, causing it to not want to feel any emotion at all. The body grieves because it can't handle the pain that has been put on it. It is your body's way of telling you, that is too painful for me. If you continue to be sad, your body will handle the stress in different ways. The first is through ignoring it. It will cause that stimuli to be overlooked in your reasoning and will try to prevent your mind from thinking about it. This is efficient for a while, so your body can recover from the shock. Its all to conserve energy. If the body can't ignore the pain, it will substitute it with pleasure. Meaning the body will develop a new perspective of that situation that will put the body to rest and not cause such great pain. It is literally teaching your body to be happy in spite of the situation. Thus your body says, I can't behave appropriately under such stress so I am going to no longer treat it as stress and find a new way to approach it. In a sense, sadness makes you immune to pain.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Are those lessons always healthy?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">It will not cause you body stress. Yes it is always healthy. It is not good for the body to suffer to much pain. Sadness also numbs the pain by nulling the stimulants.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Isn't that just ignoring it.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">No, its slowing down the response so the body can handle it in increments so it won't waste the body's resources with overload.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Wow. Is that it? Are those all the ways sadness handles stress?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Yes for now. There is a more complicated way. Essentially the body will develop a chemical that provides abundant energy to handle the situation. But that is beyond now.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Wow! That is so cool!</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">(Another way the Lord told me that the body will handle pain, is that it will take it in a little at a time. Sadness will handle its pain in portions, not all at once.)</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">…</span>\r\n<h3>Irrational Fears</h3>\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So Lord, tell me about irrational fears. Ones your logic know are inappropriate. How does your body treat those?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Irrational fears are build off of irrational perceiving. Like I said, sometimes your emotions can get ignited by certain stimuli when there are other instances when that stimuli is safe. The easiest way to retrain your perceptions is through prayer. The trait about fear is that it usually does not study the situation before acting, it is made for quick response. You can cause fear to study the situation before releasing adrenaline if you've been in the situation before. If you suddenly become afraid, quickly loosing that fear will cause your body to remember that response. If your body is acting pre-maturely, correct it when it occurs. Simply enforce in your intellect that the situation is not threatening to you. Your emotions do eventually pick up from your intellect.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Tell me about the connection between intellect and emotions? What you were starting to tell me earlier.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">You want to know how intellect can affect emotions?”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Perfect.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Your body can treat thoughts as stimulants, so that its not so much reacting to the message you want, but the words you think. As emotions mature they will act not according to the word, but according to the message. Thus in some cases, your intellect can send conscious commands to your emotions. Irrational fears can go away. If the intellect continues to be convinced of its belief despite how the emotions are acting, the emotions will adapt to the intellect's decision.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Wow. Why does that happen?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Because when the emotion's brain urges are not being responded to, they will realize that they are doing useless work.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">How quickly does that happen?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">It actually happens pretty fast. Thus the emotions look to the mind for reinforcement, if the mind does not agree, the emotions will respond appropriately.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Will you answer those two question again, I think those were my thoughts and not yours.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">The intellect can take over the body's emotional response by holding its ground. Thus the situation you were just in, your body was telling your emotions not to be afraid.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">What if your intellect and emotions are irrational?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Then your body is not convinced its irrational. However, it may still stop its course, if new information comes, or the body cannot sustain the energy.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">How does your body know how much energy to give to certain stimuli?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">It learns a lot of that through intellect.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So my intellect can make decisions about what I value and what's dangerous to me? And those decisions will affect my emotions?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Yes.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">...</span></span></span>\r\n<h3>Training your Amygdala</h3>\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Tell me more about emotions in general, you said they are energy moving around the body based on perceptions to prepare the body for experience. Are emotions always based on perceptions?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Some are based on stimuli.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Isn't that the same thing?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">No. What I mean is, some are skipping the process of perception to give you an instant response to a stimuli.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">O! The amygdala.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Yes, precisely. The amygdala is responsible to protecting the body's assets by responding quickly to situations. It is trained beforehand, not during an operation. You can calm the amygdala's sensitivity down by believing there is no threat.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">…</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I want to teach you how to negate negative feelings.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Amen. I ask for that.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">The body has the ability to feel pleasurable even when its in negative circumstances. This comes from trusting me. The body responds to my voice. If you are feeling worried, your trust in me will get rid of excessive negative emotions.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Trust huh? That seems right. Anything else?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Sadly no. The easiest thing to do in this case is to do the world's techniques. But you know the problems with those. If you trust me, I literally take over the body's emotional system and direct it myself.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">…</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Tell me something encouraging about emotions?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Emotions are sensitive to change.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">What makes them sensitive to change?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">My love. You know emotions can get in the habit of doing things one way. However, a simple word can change the way your emotions process information. A kind word can stabilize a destructive system. Your emotions will always seek to find a more positive state, they more readily change from destructive emotions to uplifting ones than the other way around. This is because the body is seeking the most efficient energy system and it knows a peaceful state will recharge energy the fastest. If given enough time, the body will seek and teach itself peace with lasting consequences. Even a troubled soul will find peace in simple time. Unless it needs that level of intensity, the body will train itself to be stable, peaceful, and joyful even in stressful times. This is why older people are usually more mature. Even if their intellect doesn't change, their body will upgrade their emotional state. So time also matures your emotions.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Wow! That's so cool. And that's encouraging to know. It means I will be more stable the older I get.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">And the more peaceful.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">That's why my dad and other people seem so stable all the time. What determines how fast time matures your emotions?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Words can make maturing faster. Your body will latch onto an encouraging word if it believes it will bring your system peace. My presence will encourage fast growth. Contrary to your belief, pain does not make the system grow faster. It gives the body reason to change, but change comes from time, not pain.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!

              "wp:comment_content": "Your very welcome! I'm amazed you got through it all! Did you do it in one sitting? That's really cool. I love your questions. \r\n\r\nYou can talk with God like that! Part of the reason I post my conversations with Him is to show people one way they can talk with God and to set an example. There are a lot of people who feel the same way you do, including myself at one point. I can understand being disappointed. I grew up in a church that encouraged hearing the Lord's voice, but no one suspected that you could have a conversation with him. I always desired to speak with him and hear him all the time. And I would be frustrated with how little I actually heard him speak or if it was even him. And at one point I misheard God terribly and I made a vow that I would never mishear Him again. Well for a whole year I heard nothing from Him. Until one day, when the Lord spoke to me for the first time in a while I asked, \"Why haven't I been hearing you all this time?\" And he said, \"You made a vow a year ago that you would never hear me wrong.\" So God had me repent of that vow and then I started hearing him again, but still not as frequently. But I begged and ask God to be able to hear his voice and he made me a promise, that I would be able to hear him all the time whenever I wanted and wherever and it would be easy to hear him. So the Lord began to teach me how to hear his voice. First he removed a lot of the faulty beliefs I had about it. Ideas like - God doesn't want to speak, God doesn't want to speak to me, God doesn't have much to say, God will go quiet if you don't obey the last thing He said, God only speaks to the mature, I can only hear him under certain conditions or if I have been obedient, etc... None of those things are true, and that's offensive. As he removed those beliefs, I began to hear him clearer and clearer. He eventually told me, \"You hear my voice for your sake, not mine. The trick to hearing my voice all the time, is to get rid of everything that says you can't.\" It is true, as God's child, spouse, body, friend, servant, lover, one in spirit, you are privileged to hear from God all the time. It is not based on your behavior. What father would stop talking to their kid? You must realize that God does speak, he is not silent. He does want to talk to YOU! Just start asking him questions and write down whatever comes to mind. Don't discern while your listening, often times you will suppose something is just you when really its God. So write down anything that comes to mind and discern afterward if it was God. You'll be surprised to find how often your thoughts really weren't your thoughts and you were actually hearing God. I am not saying we create God's voice or that we make our thoughts God's thoughts or put words in his mouth. I'm saying He can literally speak to you in your heart and mind and often times we dismiss that as random or of us. So you must train yourself not to be critical and take a risk of hearing Him wrong sometimes. Be simple with discernment. If its wise, encouraging, life-giving, practical, peaceful, loving, bears good fruit, makes your stable and hopeful then it was probably God, regardless of how much like you it sounded. If it is confusing, frustrating, irritating, frightening, or unsettling then it isn't of Him, no matter how much like Him it sounded. So to answer your question. No, you don't have to walk through a process. As of right now you can hear him all the time. Just ask him to speak to you all the time and take time to listen. But on the other hand, if you've grown up with a lot of religious rules surrounding hearing his voice, then you may have to dismantle those rules and stop telling God what he can and can't do. He will speak to you if you let him and sometimes he plays by your rules. Is God not supposed to speak to you when you've done something bad? Very well, why bother listening? But for me, I know that when I disobey is the perfect time to get a word from my father. I'm not saying God HAS to obey all your rules. I'm just saying God is willing to speak all the time, and sometimes you sacrifice that privilege to play a silly game with silly rules. So allow God to speak freely and don't hold onto beliefs that say that you can't hear him. As of now I can sit down anywhere and talk with God as long as we desire. Anytime of the day, free-flowing conversation! I wasn't born with that gift, and I don't have any special privileges. I merely asked God and let him teach me. Ask God to teach you how to hear his voice. You don't have to rely on all my lessons or someone else's lessons, learn from God yourself and be willing to take a risk. You have the holy spirit within you to teach you how. Its not hard at all. For more reading you can check out my article Conversations with God - Hearing his voice",

It was really long (very energy consuming), scientific but wonderful!\r\nA brother gave me a word recently about having joy despite difficult situations, and I personally have very sensitive emotions, so your post on joy, emotions and such is really intriguing to read!\r\nI wish I can have such clear conversation with God too... I am still learning to listen to God's voice, to discern His message, and trying to be sensitive all the time to His guidance and leading. Is this a process everyone goes through for those who want to hear God and know His heart? It is quite disappointing sometimes when I have to guess and wait to see if a certain sign or message is from God or not.",

          "content:encoded": "I wanted to take a moment to share where I'm coming from in the posts I give. My goal is not to lead people astray, cause quarrels, or offend people. My goal is to encourage and bring life to areas of death and depression in people's lives. My goal is to honor the work of Jesus and get rid of beliefs that don't give Him credit and don't produce good fruit. I believe the things I write about have God's approval, however not everything I say is perfect and I pray you give me grace for that. Its also ok if you don't agree with everything I say.\r\n\r\nHowever, because the nature of this blog is to encourage, it is not designed for arguments. So I don't try to write my posts in a way that addresses all arguements. I encourage you to research the things I say or talk to God about them. If you have questions, feel free to ask. However, if you strongly disagree with something I say and you challenge that argumentatively, as the Lord wills, I will most likely ignore your comment. Not to offend you, but because I want to promote peace and not meaningless controversies.\r\n<blockquote>James 3:17 \"But the wisdom which is from heaven is first holy, then gentle, readily giving way in argument, full of peace and mercy and good works, not doubting, not seeming other than it is.\"\r\n\r\n2 Timothy 2:24 \"And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 14:1 \"Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters.\"</blockquote>\r\nCan we agree that there are \"disputable matters\" in the way we interpret the Bible? If you disagree with anything I say let us both be fully convinced in how we serve the Lord and not pass judgement on each other. If you give a complaint and the Lord approves, I will address it. But understand if you are seeking to stir up quarrels then I will graciously ignore you comment without passing judgement.\r\n\r\nBut otherwise, feel free to comment! I love your thoughts and I'm happy to answer questions you may have! Thanks for reading.",

          "content:encoded": "I've included an audio version of this blog for your convenience.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Audio - God's Discipline\" href=\"http://chirb.it/A8exL0\" target=\"_blank\">Audio - God's Discipline</a>\r\n<h2>Hebrews 12</h2>\r\nI've been desiring to share my thoughts about the Lord's discipline for some time. This has been a major area of struggle in my life personally from false ideas about the Lord's discipline and the Lord Himself. I understand I have a very unique and differing view on discipline than most people I know, even some people who teach about God's grace. I can almost guarantee it will be offensive to worldly systems and possibly hard to digest. We have been used to hearing about discipline from one perspective that I believe discredits God's righteousness, but hopefully this new perspective will make a lot of sense. So if you are willing to hear a gracious view of God's discipline then continue reading. If you feel you already understand this topic and don't wish to hear a different perspective then I don't want to offend you.\r\n\r\nTry not to hear bitterness in this statement, but one of the beliefs that absolutely destroyed my life was this idea that God was bringing pain into my life to teach me a lesson. I thought he was, \"testing my faith,\" \"heating me in the furnace to turn me into gold,\" \"bringing me closer to him\". Because of that I misinterpreted every painful event in my life as a sign that I had God's disapproval and that I was doing something wrong. Because of this I gave up my hobbies and friendships because of painful events that I thought were associated with them. It destroyed me personally too and made me bitter towards God.\r\n\r\nIt seems the issue of discipline is the place where grace stops and where character building becomes the focus. One, two, three strikes your out! \"I'm letting grace have its effect but if grace doesn't work I'm going to switch to punishment.\" Many well meaning, sincere christians, even those who understand grace, are believing a view of God's discipline that they think is accurate to the scriptures but is actually rooted in legalism. Legalism!? No. How could it be legalistic? They carefully draw the line between punishment and discipline saying, \"God doesn't punish christians, but he disciplines them.\" What they mean by this is, if your heart is humble and trying to do the right thing, God gives you grace and doesn't punish you but if you are \"defiantly, rebelliously, pridefully living in sin\", then God will send some kind of trouble to straighten you out or \"let you fall.\" They relate God's discipline to the discipline of a good parent who loves their child. However, at the same time their picture of God's discipline is still in line with the picture of punishment. Some say God will make you sick, cause a disaster, \"hold up traffic.\" The problem I have with this teaching is that the scripture says,\r\n<blockquote>Romans 4:8 \"Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 5:13 \"<b>But sin is not taken into account</b> when <b>there is no law\"</b>\r\n\r\nHebrews 8:12 \"For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.\"\r\n\r\nEphesians 1:4 \"Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes.\"\r\n\r\nIsaiah 53:5 \"But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; <strong>The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him</strong>, And by His scourging we are healed.\"\r\n\r\nIsaiah 54:10 \"To me this is like the days of Noah, when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. So now I have sworn not to be angry with you, never to rebuke you again.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 5:9 \"Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 3:13 \"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: \"Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.\"\"\r\n\r\n1 John 4:18 \"There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.\"</blockquote>\r\nYou see, in order for God to punish your sins, he would have to remember them, hold them against you, see your faults in His eyes, impute sin against you, overlook the work of his Son, and restore the curse of the law. Why do we preach that Jesus was punished for our sins and also preach that we must be punished for our sins? Was Jesus punished in vain? Or did he only take some of the punishment? Did he only bear the eternal punishment of death? No Jesus bore stripes on his back so that we might be healed. When we try to distinguish what part of our punishment Jesus bore and what part we still have to bear things start to get confusing. Instead of being grateful for God's grace, we are afraid of his wrath! Some people will ask, \"But what about willful, defiant christians who are sinning?! Shouldn't they be disciplined!?\" Before I continue, let me say that I believe it is good for parents to discipline their children. I believe its good for people in positions of authority to bring disciplinary measures against people who are causing trouble in the church, just like Paul did, or for rulers in government to enforce the law against law breakers. These authorities were established by God. My concern is about the personal relationship between God and his children. So back on track.\r\n\r\nMy answer to that statement is, its very hard for a christians to live that way if the holy spirit is in them. And if so, God's spirit will guide them to change. Usually those people are living that way because of bitterness, not because its in their nature. I believe if they are in positions of influence, they should be graciously removed. However, we resort to these methods because we don't own the Holy Spirit to accomplish our wills in the hearts of the disobedient. That's why I believe God relates to us differently than we may to our children or the church might to troublesome members.\r\n\r\nOnce you start getting into the realm or distinguishing willful, prideful sin from \"humble sin\" you will realize that all of our sins are prideful or willful. Its very hard to draw a line, and because of that you never know whether to expect good from God or trouble from him. You are left wondering if you are right with God and your peace is gone. On top of that, you don't know whether to distinguish if a painful event in your life occurred because of some sin you committed or by accident. And even if you did find discipline in your life, that wouldn't help you to change your behavior, because the problems are not coming from a lack of will to do what's right, but of power. That's why Paul talks about, \"the good I want to do, this I do not do.\" And if someone is living rebelliously, pridefully, and willfully then he doesn't care about discipline and will ignore it just like Pharaoh did with Moses. If discipline or punishment could make you righteous, then Israel could have been justified through the law for they have a long list of punishment prescribed to them for breaking it and they would have become righteous.  However they kept falling into sin, despite being punished. If grace can't change your character, then you are out of luck, legalism will do no better. But grace must be established forever in order for it to have effect.\r\n\r\nWhen God started changing my views of his discipline he told me, \"What you call discipline, I call punishment.\" What he was saying is that what I was thinking was God's discipline in my life, God was saying there was no difference between that and punishment. I argued with Him about the subject, but he convinced me that righteousness comes from identity, gratitude, the spirit, grace, rest, and patience and not from law, punishment, fear, or human effort. So as he was teaching me, I began to wonder... what could that passage in Hebrews 12 be talking about? Doesn't it say God disciplines us? For two years I asked this question and a few weeks ago God explained to me the answer. Let's take a look at it!\r\n<h2>Hebrews 12</h2>\r\nSo we are all familiar with this passage from verse 1-12. But I would encourage you to read the book of Hebrews as a whole. Some things are best understood in context. Especially this passage. I'm going to attempt to explain its context.\r\n\r\nThe book was written to Jews who were tasting persecution and some were falling away back to Judaism because of the hardship that their faith was bringing on them. This letter was written to encourage them that their faith is superior to the law and that they should hold on and enter God's rest. Let's read the passage.\r\n<blockquote>\"Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, <sup>2 </sup>fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. <sup>3 </sup>Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow wearyand lose heart.\r\n<h3>God Disciplines His Children</h3>\r\n<sup>4 </sup>In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. <sup>5 </sup>And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son? It says,\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n“My son, do not make light of the Lord’s discipline,\r\nand do not lose heart when he rebukes you,\r\n<sup>6 </sup>because the Lord disciplines the one he loves,\r\nand he chastens everyone he accepts as his son.”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30219a\">a</a>]</sup>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<sup>7 </sup>Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children. For what children are not disciplined by their father? <sup>8 </sup>If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline—then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all. <sup>9 </sup>Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live!<sup>10 </sup>They disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, in order that we may share in his holiness.<sup>11 </sup>No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.\r\n\r\n<sup>12 </sup>Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. <sup>13 </sup>“Make level paths for your feet,”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote b\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30226b\">b</a>]</sup> so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed.\"</blockquote>\r\nLet's put this passage in context. The author declares his intentions for that passage in this earlier passage.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10 \"<sup>32 </sup>Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering. <sup>33 </sup>Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated. <sup>34 </sup>You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions. <sup>35 </sup><strong>So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.</strong>\r\n\r\n<sup>36 </sup><strong>You need to persevere</strong> so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. <sup>37 </sup>For,\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n“In just a little while,\r\nhe who is coming will come\r\nand will not delay.”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote f\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30171f\">f</a>]</sup>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<sup>38 </sup>And,\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n“But my righteous<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote g\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30172g\">g</a>]</sup> one will live by faith.\r\nAnd I take no pleasure\r\nin the one who shrinks back.”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote h\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30172h\">h</a>]</sup>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<sup>39 </sup>But we do not belong to those who shrink back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.\"</blockquote>\r\nThen in the next chapter he talks about all these great men of the faith who endured persecution and hardship because of their faith. Finally in chapter 12 he says,\r\n<blockquote>\"fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. <sup>3 </sup>Consider him who endured such opposition from sinners, so that you will not grow wearyand lose heart.\"</blockquote>\r\nHe is saying even Jesus received persecution and endured it, who was the author of our faith. Then he says,\r\n<blockquote>\"In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhat's he saying here? That they haven't whipped themselves into obedience? In hebrews, the author heavily equates sin with unbelief.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 3 and 4 \"<sup>12 </sup>See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a <strong>sinful, unbelieving heart</strong> that turns away from the living God. <sup>13 </sup>But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be <strong>hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.</strong><sup>14 </sup>We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we <strong>hold our original conviction firmly to the very end</strong>.<sup>15 </sup>As has just been said:\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\r\ndo not harden your hearts\r\nas you did in the rebellion.”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote c\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%203&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30011c\">c</a>]</sup>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<sup>16 </sup>Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? <sup>17 </sup>And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those <strong>who sinned</strong>, whose bodies perished in the wilderness? <sup>18 </sup>And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who <strong>disobeyed</strong>? <sup>19 </sup>So we see that they were not able to enter, <strong>because of their unbelief.</strong>\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it. <sup>2 </sup>For we also have had the good news proclaimed to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, <strong>because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed.</strong><sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30017a\">a</a>]</sup><sup>3 </sup>Now we who have <strong>believed</strong> enter that rest...\r\n\r\n<sup>6 </sup>Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest, and since those who formerly had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their <strong>disobedience</strong>... <sup>11 </sup>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their <strong>example of disobedience.\"</strong></blockquote>\r\nYou see, the sin he is referring to is the sin of falling away from God's rest in unbelief. For the Israelites it was faith that God would give them the promise land, but for us believers, the author is talking about the privilege that belongs to christians. That is, resting from our own works and entering into God's rest from our works of self-righteousness. He is encouraging them throughout the letter to continue strongly in their faith and freedom and not turn back to the law and fall from the grace of God.\r\n\r\nSo what is this verse saying? It is saying that you have not had your belief tested to the point where the persecution literally took your blood. Essentially you have not endured beatings for your faith yet.\r\n<blockquote>\"In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.\"</blockquote>\r\nFollowing me so far? Right afterwards he says,\r\n<blockquote>\"And have you completely forgotten this word of encouragement that addresses you as a father addresses his son?\"</blockquote>\r\nWhat he is about to explain, the passage of God's discipline he calls a \"word of encouragement.\" I belief this stems from a belief that the jews had. I'm not sure if this is completely accurate, but I believe around that time the jews saw trouble and persecution as a sign of God's rejection. Poverty was a sign of God's disapproval. After all did not God say that he would curse them with poverty if they did not obey his commands? What he is saying is that these signs are not telling them that God is displeased with them or rejecting them, but they show that in fact they are accepted as God's children and members of his family! These persecutions come because we are children of God who obey his voice.\r\n\r\nHe then reads from a passage of proverbs that was written to the Jews under the time of the law. God disciplined the jews to keep his covenant. In that time keeping the covenant meant obeying the law, for us today, keeping the covenant is resting in faith. We are to enter that rest, even when it causes us hardship.\r\n<blockquote>\"<sup>7 </sup>Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhat he is talking about is persecution. <strong>God's discipline is Him asking you to hold onto your faith even when it causes you trouble or persecution. </strong>All who are sons of God will undergo these kinds of sufferings and they mark you as children of God, echoing the words of Jesus.\r\n<blockquote>John 15:18 \"If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first... If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also.</blockquote>\r\nLater he says what child is not disciplined by his father. In other words, what son of God is not asked to endure. Then he says, you were willing to submit to your fathers in earthly discipline, how much more should you be willing to endure if God asks it of you. Then he says, he disciplines us for our good. He asks us to endure for our sakes. Remember the words of Jesus.\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 5:11-12 \"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\"</blockquote>\r\nGod asks us to endure that we may share in his holiness. Holiness means \"to be set apart.\" We are sharing in the distinction ('set apartness') as being God's children from the fact the the world hates us and causes us trouble. No discipline seems pleasant but painful. That's true, persecutions are not lovely when you are going through them. Then he says, \"Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.\" Remember the author's words earlier...\r\n<blockquote>\"You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.\"</blockquote>\r\nYour faith brings great reward. It is the free gift of righteousness and the peace of being right with God apart from your performance, if you hold to God's words and remain in his rest, despite the persecution it brings you are harvesting righteousness and peace from the gospel you cling to. Then the author uses an Old Testament reference in this scripture,\r\n<blockquote>\"<sup>12 </sup>Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees. <sup>13 </sup>“Make level paths for your feet,”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote b\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30226b\">b</a>]</sup> so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed.\"</blockquote>\r\nHe is quoting from a passage in Isaiah 35 where Israel was enduring persecution from her enemies. Isaiah was encouraging them to endure because God was going to come an rescue them from their enemies and bring vengeance on those who did them evil.\r\n<blockquote>\"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/isaiah/35-3.htm\"><b>3</b></a>Strengthen the feeble hands,\r\n\r\nsteady the knees that give way;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bible.cc/isaiah/35-4.htm\"><b>4</b></a>say to those with fearful hearts,\r\n\r\n“Be strong, do not fear;\r\n\r\nyour God will come,\r\n\r\nhe will come with vengeance;\r\n\r\nwith divine retribution\r\n\r\nhe will come to save you.”\"</blockquote>\r\nSo the author is using this passage to tell these Hebrews that God will deliver you out of these persecutions and to hold on through them.\r\n\r\nSo in essence, God is not disciplining these Hebrews for their sin. They are being disciplined because of righteousness. They are being persecuted because they believe they have been made righteous apart from works and the rituals of the law. And those who still believe in those things are bringing them trouble. God's discipline is asking them to continue to believe and enter God's rest despite the trouble others bring because of it. Just like when the Israelites were afraid to enter because of the giants, so God is telling us \"do not be afraid to enter or remain in my rest despite the persecution.\"\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 4:11 \"So let us do our best to enter that rest. But if we disobey God, as the people of Israel did, we will fall.\"</blockquote>\r\nSo that is what I felt the Lord told me about his discipline. He said, \"I was talking about persecution.\" God is not causing the persecutions but He does predict them and he knows the faith He gives you may invite that. Remember James 1:17\r\n<blockquote>\"Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.\"</blockquote>\r\nGod can only give good and perfect gifts to his children. He cannot cause sickness, traffic problems, or troubles at work to teach you a lesson. He does not change like the shifting shadows, giving good gifts today and then bad things the next. He does not cause the persecutions either but does ask that you to hold onto your faith despite them.\r\n\r\nThere are two other passages in the new testament that address God's discipline, but I will get to them later. One is in Revelation, and the other is in Corinthians about communion. I would encourage you to read some of the blogs I follow on these subjects for now, they answer some of these questions.\r\n\r\nHere is one on communion. I am still studying these passages but my view point is that the people being judged were unbelievers who were participating in communion with the christians. For instance earlier he says,\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthains 11 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/11-18.htm\"><b>18</b></a>In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/11-19.htm\"><b>19</b></a>No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval.\"</blockquote>\r\nI think there are professing christians in that church but who are merely believing it to have access to the privileges in the church and don't really have God's approval. Of course I could be wrong. But I'm thinking that they came not because they wanted to honor Christ but because they wanted to get drunk. And they were stealing the meal from some of the christians. Here is <a title=\"http://escapetoreality.org/2013/03/31/can-unbelievers-take-communion/\" href=\"http://escapetoreality.org/2013/03/31/can-unbelievers-take-communion/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Ellis's</a> perspective of it.\r\n\r\nSo overall I believe that God uses his spirit and the power of his love and grace to change our hearts and behaviors and doesn't revert back to the punishments of the law to train us into holy living. If you understand that you won't be paranoid or afraid. You will be able to expect good from God and have peace and trust in Him, knowing he is for you. You will also be able to rest from your introspection of your sins and believe in the righteousness He's given you! God bless!\r\n\r\nPS: In these passages I've addressed, I don't believe he is talking in terms of salvation, but of the practical side of our faith which is living in rest.\r\n\r\nHere is a link by Escape to Reality about the Lord's correction. I think it will conclude lingering questions about how then does God train us. <a title=\"Here is a link by Escape to Reality about the Lord's correction.

This is the original conversation I had with God about discipline before He began revealing to me the scriptures in context. If you are wondering about my views on discipline, I would recommend reading that article first. This article brings in the raw conversation I had with Him beforehand.\r\n\r\nAs always, I don't always hear everything correct, so please give me grace from times I mishear God's voice.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><b>Discipline</b></span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Tell me about discipline God? How do you discipline? When do you discipline?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">How does righteousness come?”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Through the spirit as a gift.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">What is a harvest of righteousness?”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Many good works?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Righteousness is given through faith. It is faith to believe God. In times of discipline, faith is released to trust God.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">What about, God disciplines us for our good that we may share in his holiness?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">It means I ask you to endure for my sake and not give up. In the face of persecution, I am the one asking that you hold onto your faith. I detest persecution, but it will come on those who follow me, and my will is that they endure it for my sake and receive their reward.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Wow, thanks.

Those to persevere proclaim the kingdom through their deeds and win the hearts of many. This is why the early martyrs were so effective at changing a nation. Their holiness was seen by all and persecution brought it out.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">What about the verse, he disciplines us for our good?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">There is immense reward for those who endure trial and persecution.

But there is a chastisement that comes because of righteousness. The world is offended at the free gift of righteousness. When I chastise my children, I am asking them to trust me even in the midst of trouble and pain.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So I shouldn't look at this verse as you punish my sins?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I don't. Your sins have been adequately punished. Now endure temptation for my sake. I will keep you strong in your faith and see you to the end.

They were punished to keep the covenant. You however are under a different covenant and the punishment you receive is simply my willingness for you to trust, follow, hope, and endure persecution for my sake.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Wow, thanks again.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">That doesn't make much sense that you punishing us is asking us to endure temptation because of the gospel.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">And what does make sense?”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">That you train me not to sin.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">You are thinking of punishment in an old covenant context.

Because of my word you suffer wrath.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So in a sense you are creating it because it is because of the word you gave us that we are being persecuted.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">That's a good way to think about it. It is as you say.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">What about 'you discipline' and 'you are treating us as children'?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I am treating you as a son, by asking you to follow me.

Why do you need to strengthen your feeble knees?”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Because you are coming to save.</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I am going to save.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">It doesn't make sense. How can your discipline be asking you to hold on?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Because you are suffering for it.”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">And you cause it?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I am pleased when my children endure for my sake, but I do not enjoy watching them suffer. You ask if I cause it. Why would I cause my children suffering?”</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">To give them reward?</span></span></span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I can do that through my son.

          "content:encoded": "<p align=\"LEFT\">Here is a conversation I had with God about his will in people's lives. It is by no means comprehensive but I think it scratches the surface of God's heart for people.</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">(Sometimes I mishear God, give me grace for such mistakes and enjoy the read.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 align=\"LEFT\">What is God's Will in My Life?</h1>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I see a lot of college students looking for your will and purpose in their life. Some don't have any idea.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">They have not been taught my will is in them. It is no</span></span><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\">t outside, so that you have to go looking for it. I place my will in their hearts and draw it on their minds. 'F</span><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\">or it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.' What many are looking for in signs I have written in their hearts in a way that only they can know and understand. You see, the will of God is not this separate entity from my children so that they have no clue what it is until they search. It is very near, woven into your very desires and thought patterns. It is the gentle voice that draws you. Many have been told that God's will must look a certain way, and so instead of following the wisdom I've placed in their hearts they go looking to a great spiritual leader to impart purpose and meaning to their lives. A spiritual leader's wisdom cannot replace the wisdom I've put inside my children. So my advise to the students is this, 'What God has purposed He will accomplish.'</span><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\">”</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So you are saying we should recognize God's will by the desires he places in our hearts and understand that we can't miss it.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\">The promptings of the spirit will guide your steps.”</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">What is your will?</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\">That all of them should know me, from the least of them to the greatest and be given the kingdom and the superabundance of grace in Christ Jesus. My will is that all come to the revelation of their hope and the assurance of love. And this love says, 'Do not be afraid. I have called you, and I will perform what I have destined in your life.' My will draws out the full expression of who you are in boldness and assurance that only comes from the freedom of the gospel. Understanding my grace releases people into my kingdom and into their life's purposes. Without my grace, even fulfilling my will feels miserable and lifeless. This is because my will is not accomplished by human hands, by the good intentions of man. It is accomplished in a heart that is overflowing with gratitude. When you show people the kindness of God, you are releasing them to overcome the world and walk in victory of every area of lack in their life. So the gospel releases the power live upright in a way that is pleasing and approved by God.”</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So you're saying we must be rooted in grace or else trying to fulfill our calling will feel lifeless.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\">You cannot work out what has not been worked in you. If you want to accomplish my will in all its glory, you must learn that I never demand what I don't impart. If you are rooted in grace, you never have to ask what is God's will in my life, you know in your heart and mind and spirit and you walk in it effortlessly.”</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">So what would you tell those who cry out for your purpose in their life?</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“</span><span><span><span><span style=\"color:#008080;font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;font-size:medium;\">I would tell them, “To be loved by God and nothing more.' Their hearts are seeking for a way to serve an idea they have of God. But if that idea does not come out of their hearts being rooted in grace, then no matter how good it looks, it will stink of <span style=\"line-height:27px;\">death. </span>My love empowers greatness. Greatness does not empower my love.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">You don't mean 'and nothing more' do you?</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\">Nothing beyond the love of God will accomplish his will in your life, not a word, not a thought, not a work. If you add to or subtract from his love, then whatever is added becomes a burden and whatever is subtracted becomes a strain. And I never strain my children for the sake of them proving their love to me.”</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">This has been a good conversation God.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\">I liked it too.

I believe this to be sort of a transitional book; one perhaps written to Jews who were coming to faith. And like Jesus did, James is helping to support the fact that no man can be justified by law. The law was their tutor to lead them to Christ; but when faith came,  there was no need for a tutor. If you read the epistles written to Gentile churches, they don't mention the law of Moses as much as James. Also, I have been sorting through some things about unforgiveness and if that \"un-saves\" the saved. The more I look at the New Testament, the more I see it is in favor of the mercy that you wrote about. Thanks for the post.",

However, I didn't know that when he said, \"Forgive or you will not be forgiven\" was a statement of the law. However it is in Leviticus and Deuteronomy as statements of the law. What he is saying is that even if you obey every good command but you don't forgive, you are still convicted as a lawbreaker. James is saying the same thing. That's why he says to speak and act as though you will be judged by the law that gives freedom and not the law that binds. Because under the law you are condemned, but in grace mercy will be shown you.\r\n\r\nI like your perspective of James, I will have to read it with that perspective.",

          "content:encoded": "This can be a difficult passage of scripture that has a lot of controversy. However, if you read the book of Hebrews as a whole, the passage makes a lot more sense. It is good to put it into context. In the words of Joseph Prince, \"If you take a text out of its context, you are left with a con.\"\r\n\r\nMany people have been troubled over this passage in Hebrews 10.\r\n<blockquote>\"If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, <sup>27 </sup>but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.<sup>28 </sup>Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. <sup>29 </sup>How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? <sup>30 </sup>For we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote d\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30164d\">d</a>]</sup> and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote e\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30164e\">e</a>]</sup><sup>31 </sup>It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</blockquote>\r\nOne of my close friends was deeply convicted by this verse and fell into condemnation and looked miserable. He thought it was the Lord. When he preached about this verse it sent a chill of dread into the listeners, and one man asked, \"But what sins aren't willful?\" That statement was echoed in the hearts of everybody, and it was the belief that convicted my close friend into condemnation. This is not the spirit of grace.\r\n<h2>Robbing Your Peace</h2>\r\nWe would probably all agree that if we don't know its a sin or realize that we are doing it then its not willful. However, you and I are both aware that the majority of our sins do not fall into that category, or at least it would seem. At what point do you have the audacity to say that you weren't committing a willful sin? When can you be convinced that you've tried hard enough to not sin? You may try to resist, but that thought in the back of your head will say, \"You only tried a little in order not to feel bad. But you didn't try hard enough, it is still willful.\"\r\n\r\nThese aren't the kind of questions we need to be asking ourselves, but I use it to make a point, that almost no matter what angle we look at it, our hearts and consciences know the majority of our sins can be seen as willful. And if that can pull us away from God, either through one sin or many, there is no hope for the Christian. As long as you look at this verse as talking about sinning to much or too strong you will have no peace with God and it won't be in line with the gospel. So what could this passage be saying?\r\n<h2>Talking about Unbelief</h2>\r\nKeep in mind that the message to the Hebrews is written to Jews whom he is encouraging to persevere in their faith. He warns them against falling away as the Israelites did in the desert. In Hebrews, the author heavily equates sin with unbelief.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 3 and 4 “<sup>12 </sup>See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has a <strong>sinful, unbelieving heart</strong> that turns away from the living God. <sup>13 </sup>But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be <strong>hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.</strong><sup>14 </sup>We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we <strong>hold our original conviction firmly to the very end</strong>.<sup>15 </sup>As has just been said:\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\r\ndo not harden your hearts\r\nas you did in the rebellion.”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote c\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%203&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30011c\">c</a>]</sup>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<sup>16 </sup>Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? <sup>17 </sup>And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those <strong>who sinned</strong>, whose bodies perished in the wilderness? <sup>18 </sup>And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who <strong>disobeyed</strong>? <sup>19 </sup>So we see that they were not able to enter, <strong>because of their unbelief.</strong>“\r\n\r\nTherefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it. <sup>2 </sup>For <strong>we also have had the good news proclaimed to us</strong>, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, <strong>because they did not share the faith of those who obeyed. </strong><sup>3 </sup>Now we who have <strong>believed</strong> enter that rest…\r\n\r\n<sup>6 </sup>Therefore since it still remains for some to enter that rest, and since those who formerly had the <strong>good news proclaimed to them</strong> did not go in because of their <strong>disobedience</strong>… <sup>11 </sup>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their <strong>example of disobedience.”</strong></blockquote>\r\nThe author uses the words sin and unbelief interchangeably. The Israelites were tempted to doubt God's promise of entering his rest in the promise land. But, these Hebrews were being tempted by pious Jews to turn back to the law and the animal sacrifices and doubt the salvation of Jesus Christ. Just before the passage this article is written about he is talking about how the new covenant is superior to judaism and how Christ's sacrifice is superior to the law or animal sacrifices.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10 - “Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,\r\nbut a body you prepared for me;\r\n<sup>6 </sup>with burnt offerings and sin offerings\r\nyou were not pleased.\r\n<sup>7 </sup>Then I said, ‘Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll—\r\nI have come to do your will, my God.’”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30141a\">a</a>]</sup>\r\n\r\n<sup>8 </sup>First he said, “<strong>Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them</strong>”—though they were offered in accordance with the law. <sup>9 </sup>Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second. <sup>10 </sup>And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ <strong>once for all.</strong>\r\n\r\n<sup>11 </sup>Day after day every priest <strong>stands</strong> and performs his religious duties; <strong>again and again</strong> he <strong>offers the same sacrifices</strong>, which can <strong>never take away sins</strong>.<sup>12 </sup>But when this priest had offered <strong>for all time one sacrifice for sins</strong>, he <strong>sat down</strong> at the right hand of God, <sup>13 </sup>and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool. <sup>14 </sup>For by <strong>one sacrifice</strong> he has made <strong>perfect forever</strong> those who are being made holy.\r\n\r\n<sup>15 </sup>The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says:\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<sup>16 </sup>“This is the covenant I will make with them\r\nafter that time, says the Lord.\r\nI will put my laws in their hearts,\r\nand I will write them on their minds.”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote b\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30150b\">b</a>]</sup>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<sup>17 </sup>Then he adds:\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n“<strong>Their sins and lawless acts</strong>\r\n<strong>    I will remember no more.</strong>”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote c\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30151c\">c</a>]</sup>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<sup>18 </sup>And where these have been forgiven, <strong>sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary</strong>.</blockquote>\r\nHe is encouraging these Hebrews, that Christ has become the end of animal sacrifices. That God was not pleased with them and they have Jesus as their once and for all sacrifice. Then he gives a beautiful statement how we are freed from guilt and may enter God's presence boldly. Afterwards he gives this warning.\r\n<blockquote><sup>\"26 </sup>If we <strong>deliberately keep on sinning</strong> after we have received the knowledge of the truth, <strong>no sacrifice for sins is left</strong>, <sup>27 </sup>but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the <strong>enemies of God</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhat deliberate sin is he talking about? Lust, pride, selfishness? He is talking about ritual acts of unbelief. If Jesus's sacrifice covered your sins once and for all, then offering an animal for your sins becomes an act of unbelief and is actually an insult to Christ's work. Remember how earlier in Hebrews he equates sin with unbelief? He is talking about those pious Jews who continually turn away from faith in Jesus, rejecting His new covenant, refusing to enter his rest, and instead hold on to the law for justification.\r\n<h2>Talking about Unbelievers</h2>\r\nI believe the phrase, \"have received the knowledge of truth,\" does not necessarily imply that they were saved, only that they were given the message and then rejected it.\r\n<blockquote>1 John 2:19 \"They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.\"</blockquote>\r\nHebrews 10:26 is talking about unbelievers. But to illustrate this, I must explain more thoroughly what God's rest is. God's rest is closely tied to salvation.\r\n<blockquote>Isaiah 30:15 \"In repentance and rest is your salvation,\r\nin quietness and trust is your strength,\"</blockquote>\r\nThey are not perfectly the same, but God's rest is a natural extension, product, benefit, or integral part of salvation. The very statement of the Christian faith, that Jesus died for my sins so that I could be forgiven, shows us what this rest may look like. If I have been forgiven by Jesus once and for all, what else do I need to do to remain forgiven? What Hebrews is saying, is that any work we add to the finished work of Christ in order to remain forgiven becomes a dead work, a useless labor. Those works only serve to mock what Jesus did and they show that we don't really believe we are forgiven. Thus the natural consequence of being saved and properly instructed, that if you really honor Christ's work, is you will inevitability stop performing these and enter God's rest.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 4:3 \"Now we who have believed enter that rest\"</blockquote>\r\nThe defiant and willful sin the author is referring to, is not amoral acts as we think of it, but is defiant and willful sin like the Israelites who fell in the desert, through ignoring God's words and failing to enter his rest.\r\n\r\nNow, throughout Hebrews the author is warning christians who are continuing to perform these dead works in ignorance. They genuinely want to honor Jesus's sacrifice, but because they were not properly taught the message of grace and the word of righteousness, they continue performing these, not knowing that they serve to insult christ and make their faith seem worthless.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 5 \"11 We have much to say about this, but it is hard to make it clear to you because you no longer try to understand. 12 In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God’s word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! 13 Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. 14 But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 6 \"1 Let us go forward, then, to mature teaching and leave behind us the first lessons of the Christian message. We should not lay again the foundation of turning away from useless works and believing in God (entering his rest); 2 of the teaching about baptisms and the laying on of hands; of the resurrection of the dead and the eternal judgment. 3 Let us go forward! And this is what we will do, if God allows.\" (Parenthesis are mine)</blockquote>\r\nThis is what I believe Hebrews 6 leans toward. But Hebrews 10 tells us a different story. We are no longer seeing someone act in ignorance, but someone who has no honor for Christ's work whatsoever. Though they have heard that Christ defeated sin once and for all and has made us clean, these pious jews treat it as though it were worthless and willfully and defiantly continue to offer their sacrifices and dead rituals in insult to Christ work. Thus by their very deeds they show they were never saved. For if they did believe Christ's work was effectual, would they not realize the error of their way and put their faith in God instead? No, but we see that the reason they do not enter God's rest is because they don't believe in Christ at all!\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 7:16 \"By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?\"</blockquote>\r\n<h2>No more sacrifice for sins?</h2>\r\nWhen he says, <em>'there is no more sacrifice for sin,</em>' he is not saying that Christ's sacrifice becomes void, though you could see it that way from one perspective, but rather what he is saying is that since Christ has become the end to animal sacrifices, you cannot find a sacrifice in any other place besides the one you rejected in Christ. If those who have heard the good news of the gospel preached to them continually and deliberately ignore it for their own rituals, there is no other sacrifice left to cover them, they are under the judgment of God.\r\n<h2>Enemies of God</h2>\r\nThese pious Jews have no more sacrifice because Jesus has done away with it (one can't be forgiven on that basis anymore) and they are considered <strong>enemies of God</strong>. So its clear he is not talking to Christians. A christian cannot be an enemy of God because Christ's sacrifice has reconciled him.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 5:10 \"For if, when we were <strong>God's enemies</strong>, we were <strong>reconciled</strong> to him through the death of his Son, <strong>how much more</strong>, having been reconciled, <strong>shall we be saved</strong> through <strong>his life</strong>!\"</blockquote>\r\nHow are we saved? Through his life. This is because Jesus's life is a guarantee of the righteousness he's given us. Because he's died to the imputation of sin once and for all and cannot die again, you also have died to the imputation of sin once and for all and cannot die again.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 6:11 \"The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.\"</blockquote>\r\nIs he talking about the power of sin in the sense of living holy? He talks about that shortly after. Actually you must ask, how did Christ die to sin? Did Christ die to sinful desires? Did he overcome the lust that was in him? No! Christ was perfect. He died to the reckoning and punishment of your sin. We have died in the same manner. Now his life is a guarantee that we are forever righteous.\r\n<blockquote>1 John 2:1 \"My dear children, I am writing this to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate who pleads our case before the Father. He is Jesus Christ, the one who is truly righteous\"\r\n\r\nColossians 1: \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/colossians/1-21.htm\"><b>21</b></a>Once you were alienated from God and were <strong>enemies in your minds</strong> because of<sup><a href=\"http://niv.scripturetext.com/colossians/1.htm#footnotesf\">f</a></sup> your evil behavior. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/colossians/1-22.htm\"><b>22</b></a>But now he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation\"</blockquote>\r\nNow let get back on track. If he is calling these deliberate sinners \"enemies of God\", then it stands to reason that they were never reconciled to him through Jesus. You may say when he says,\r\n<blockquote><sup>\"26 </sup>If <strong>we </strong>deliberately keep on sinning...<strong>\"</strong></blockquote>\r\nthat he is talking about believers themselves. But I believe he is using \"we\" here in the sense of humanity, not in the sense of we christians. He might even be further specifying \"we\" as in \"we Jews\", for in context he's talking about problems that are almost specifically Jewish.\r\n<blockquote>\"If we humans/jews deliberately keep on sinning...\"</blockquote>\r\nHowever, the result is an '<em>expectation of judgement and of raging fire.</em>' This is perhaps being used to allude to the future destruction of the temple in Jerusalem in 70 AD. Meaning, that that judgement that Jesus had prophesied would come on those who would be found serving in the temple at that time, continuing to offer their sacrifices in unbelief.\r\n<h2>Rejecting a covenant</h2>\r\nFurther down,\r\n<blockquote>\"Anyone who <strong>rejected the law of Moses</strong> died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses\"</blockquote>\r\nYou can see he is talking about rejecting a covenant. The old covenant was based on the law of Moses, but the new covenant is based on belief in Jesus and the resulting rest.\r\n<blockquote>\"How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?\"</blockquote>\r\nHow do you trample the Son of God underfoot? By considering his sacrifice worthless (which is a picture of what these pious Jews were doing by continuing to offer up animal sacrifices). How do you treat as unholy thing the blood of the covenant? Act as though it didn't matter or couldn't save you. How do you insult the spirit of grace? Through disobeying too much? Of course not! That's why there's grace to begin with! The only way you can insult grace is to reject or belittle it. Then he quotes from the old testament,\r\n<blockquote>“It is mine to avenge; I will repay,”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote d\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30164d\">d</a>]</sup> and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”</blockquote>\r\nYou might think by \"his people\" he is referring to Christians, but in fact he is not talking about Christians, but Jews, who were called all through the old testament \"his people.\" This passage was written about Jews under the old covenant and the author is giving it to Jews here in this letter.\r\n\r\nThese unbelieving pious Jews are trying to pull these young christian jews away from Christ by convincing them that they need to continue doing these rituals and labors. The author is talking about these \"unbelieving role models\" saying, those who live like that are going to their own destruction, therefore don't follow them. You are not among those who are destroyed but among those who are saved.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10:39 \"But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those <strong>who believe</strong> and are saved.\"</blockquote>\r\nThese christian Jews will not come under the same judgement, though they themselves struggle with dead works to some degree. And God will purify their conscience of these dead works so they can serve him appropriately. Read my blog <a title=\"Hebrews 6 - Falling Away\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/hebrews-6/\" target=\"_blank\">hebrews 6</a>. Even if you commit the sin of dead works, you are saved, although you will have missed the rest of God and toiled in vain. So Hebrews 6 is referring to believers (or possibly unbelievers) (it's not clear which) who are missing God's rest. Hebrews 10 is referring to the tempters (pious unbelieving Jews) who deliberately disregard what Jesus did and are pulling these christian jews into dead works.\r\n\r\nSo even though the author is guiding christian jews to enter God's rest from their dead works, he is only speaking destruction on those who reject Christ altogether. So don't let this verse destroy your confidence, we have a great high priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 4-5 \"14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. 15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin. 16 Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. 1Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 2 He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness. 3 This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.\"</blockquote>\r\nYou need to make sure your understanding of this verse does not contradict the rest of the scripture. For instance,\r\n<blockquote>2 Corinthians 5 \"17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!18All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation:19that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, <strong>not counting men’s sins against them</strong>. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.\"\r\n\r\nJohn 5:24 \"Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. <strong>He does not come into judgment</strong>, but has passed from death to life.\"</blockquote>\r\nAs Joseph Prince says, 'Do not let obscure passages rob you of the truth and joy of clear passages.' This obscure passage in Hebrews is talking about the sin of rejecting a covenant entirely. We must be patient with our fellow christians who struggle to enter God's rest. They think that what they are doing what honors the Lord, but they act in ignorance, even though sometimes it seems like they are stubborn and willful about it. We must pray for them and teach so that God may give them a revelation of his rest and that they would not find themselves angry that all their work was useless.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

          "content:encoded": "<p align=\"LEFT\">Here is a conversation I had with the Lord about rewards and serving. His answers may be controversial. I encourage you to talk to the Lord yourself on these subjects in addition to reading this conversation.</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">I ask that you use discernment as you read, I sometimes suppose I'm writing one of God's thoughts and find I'm writing one of my own.</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Do you desire that I have a servant's heart?</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I desire that you are willing to do good. But I am patient and I do not hold offense. My heart is not that you should fear to do good, but that it comes out of your heart in joyful willingness. I never make demands except where there is unbelief. I will never ask you to do more for me than that. Any deed beyond that is extra icing for me. And nothing you do beyond that will change your position with me, otherwise I would be a partial judge. No service done to me will accomplish any more than your own good in this life. I do not show favoritism, but where the heart is willing, there I reveal my grace and superabounding kindness. And if the heart prospers then your service will prosper and you will become a willing servant who does not wish to leave his master. Such servants will hold much joy in my kingdom, for they have set their hope on heavenly things and have shunned the treasures of this world. Remember the parable of the workers. At the end of the day, even though they worked different hours, they were all given the same wage.”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Then is there any reward for doing good?</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">You will be well compensated for any sacrifice you make in my name. And all service done unto me will be credited to your account, both in this life and in the life to come. But realize this, even if you do work in order to obtain a blessing from me, I will still give my blessing freely to the one who asks. You will not be shown preference over the one who comes to me in humility even though you are deserving and he is not. If you take offense you will be acting in the spirit of the older brother in the parable of the lost son. Thus do not limit my generosity by your deeds.”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">How can you say we will be compensated and also say you give freely? Wouldn't it make sense that I would always seek your blessing on the basis of your grace and not my merits?</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Why would you seek reward if you are given all by grace? Because sometimes people see rewards as God's approval and some will never come to me unless they believe they have earned it. One man slaves for his wages, while the other trusts. Both are given the same wage even though one acted in faith and the other in perseverance. There is not as you think a pile of rewards that will be given out to each individual when he reaches heaven. Everything good in heaven is shared. But you may boast in the deeds done here on earth and rejoice in the profits and benefits it produces in this life before and after you are here. And everything good you do brings praise to my name. It is to my glory that you do good works. This is what I desire, grateful servants eager to do what is right. I do not break the wills of the weak. I am compassionate and slow to anger and I will show mercy to the undeserving. I tell you the truth, some who are less deserving will receive abundantly more than the conquerers and good doers in this life. Thus in all your good doing, do out of a heart of joy so that your service will be a joy to you and not a burden. And let my graces be the ruler of your heart, so that you expect good from me when you have done good and when you have done evil. Trust in my goodness apart from your performance and your performance will prosper.”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">God you are so good! I wished I praised you more.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">You do in your heart! And that speaks louder than your mouth any day. You have asked me some deep questions. And some will not understand this is what I desire. I tell you the truth, you may train your kids with rewards when they are younger, but as they mature they will show you kindness not because of the rewards given to them, but because of the joy of their relationship. In the same way, the heart of the believer will not do good deeds out of the reluctance of his heart, but out of a heart that is full of grace. So whatever you do, in deed, in prayer, in work, do in the willingness that comes from the heart and do so in a contented joy so as not to add or subtract anything from your life. I am God and I will bless each man for what he has done.”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">How can you say to do good so as not to add or subtract anything and yet say you bless us for what we have done?</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Who measures the deeds of man?! Who calls a man righteous or unrighteous? Who can fathom the heart of the giver? I tell you some will be surprised to find their service is not worth the prayer of the poor man. Therefore do not be evil judges, envying each other for the favor God shows them, but seek his kingdom and you shall have just as you have seen. Do not question the judgements of the Lord, they are not like the judgements of man. Establish yourself in my righteousness and grace and I tell you whatever you put your hand to, be it small or big shall prosper because of the overflowing favor I give you.”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Thanks God! We will finish this conversation later!</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Good night servant!”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"> </span></span></span></p>",

              "wp:comment_content": "A good guess about reputation and personal rewards brother. I believe in reputation also. It's interesting that Jesus told the two brothers the seats to his left and right hand side were arranged by the Father and that to be first he would have to be a slave to others. But he never told them they couldn't earn the two places. He never even said that the places were occupied by angels, although I would never dream of sitting there.\r\n\r\nA lot of Christians think reputation doesn't change because all sins are paid, but the mere fact that sins are paid doesn't necessarily mean that people could not beat each other in the rankings for good deeds, even if it's a purely nominal concept. \r\n\r\nHaha I understand how hard it is to distinguish what God said. It is already hard enough to distinguish what our own soul may say in this instance. Maybe one second it thirsts for rewards out of a desire to earn more than others, maybe another second it does not want rewards to be scaled because of the detestability of being deprived of rewards others got. \r\n\r\nYour style of hearing is curiously lopsided. Nearly all of the average Christians who supposedly \"hear from God\" once in a while but they just give mundane quotes, 1 sentence advice or otherwise yes or no answers. Ask them for specifics and they'll shiver and flee. But you seem to have very fitting parables and connections spring out of your mind that are very specific, and yet struggle more at the yes or no questions. That makes perfect sense though. The yes or no questions are the ones the mind is most susceptible to answering.",

I wondered about that myself when I heard it and at other times it has seems like the Lord said there would be rewards. So take it as you will, I might need to take down this post. \r\n\r\nI think what I felt like the Lord was saying is that there is nothing good that won't be given. That it's not a systematized, \"you get this,\" \"you get that,\" and were stuck for eternity with whatever reward or lack we got. It's not a competition or comparison between believers. Each reward is immensely personal.\r\n\r\nI would also assume the picture of rewards on judgement day is not so much a large pile of gold for doing well, but perhaps more of a... reputation? The impact you had on this earth will show and you will carry with you the honor of those deeds you did and the people you reached. This needs to be examined closer, I put it up because it raised some interesting questions.\r\n\r\nThanks for commenting!",

I like how you don't go with other theologists who try to squeeze themselves out of a corner by using almost ridiculous arguments.\r\n\r\nI've seen desperate grace theologists comment on the \"seeds choked by thorns\" and certain \"warnings\" to those who \"received the gospel\" in Paul's letters by saying that receiving is not the same as accepting the gospel. I mean, seriously, even receiving and accepting are distinguished? I'm not convinced.\r\n\r\nAnd as for the example above, I've seen all sorts of things on the internet like \"your sins will be played like a video in front of all heaven but you will rejoice and not panic because heaven will see how god's grace worked on you\"...Rejoice? I think I'll go hide in a cave somewhere in heaven for the rest of the Feast and eternity afterwards. Definitely not convinced.\r\n\r\nAnd there are other sites that say \"part of that will be answering your sins but that is not going to be the primary focus\"-just completely just tries to brush it away without any success.\r\n\r\nAnd regarding prayers there are so many people just saying \"you're qualified-shut up-believe\".

Therefore God will fulfil his promise of rewards, and will also fulfil his promise of free blessing. Consider \" each according to what he has done\". The only obligation here is to give you what your good deeds have deserved. The obligation here isn't to give others any less if they have done less than you. You might both end up with a stock of equal value, but God will have paid you both back for the good that you have done",

I haven't noticed its ending before. Why does it say \"whether good or bad\"? If this is about rewards, why will God bring into account the bad that is done? But if this is about judgement, why do we have to reflect on our lives? It was him who told me to forget my old nature wasn't it?",

But it also means \"valuable or worthless.\" Meaning, if you are working for worthless gain, it will not come to anything, but when you are doing work which is profitable then you will reap a reward from it. I heard one pastor say that this was not rewards in the sense of consequences, such as I will be rewarded for good and punished for bad. But rewards in a fully positive sense. In the final day I will see the results of all my work. Those that had value will return to me it's blessing. If I plant dry seeds on my land, then it will not produce a crop and I will be disappointed with how that work turned out. But if I plant seeds that have life in them, they will produce and I will be glad at their return. Our ministry here is like the work we do for the kingdom. If we waste our time in dead works and ministering death rather than life, we will see it for what it was on judgement day. But if we are doing works which are valuable to God and ministering the ministry of life, we will have something to be proud of on the final day!",

          "content:encoded": "I am including an audio version of this blog for your convenience.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"Audio 1 Peter 4 - Hard to be Saved\" href=\"http://chirb.it/M1ghgM\" target=\"_blank\">Audio 1 Peter 4 - Hard to be Saved</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI want to look at a difficult passage of scripture, that I just had an inspired thought about. I say the scripture is difficult because it contradicts other bits of scripture and seems to suggest that salvation is hard for the believer to obtain. I believe my understanding of the scripture came from the Holy Spirit, but we will see. Let me pull up the scripture.\r\n<blockquote><strong>1 Peter 4 Suffering for Being a Christian</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_peter/4-12.htm\"><b>12</b></a>Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_peter/4-13.htm\"><b>13</b></a>But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_peter/4-14.htm\"><b>14</b></a>If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_peter/4-15.htm\"><b>15</b></a>If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_peter/4-16.htm\"><b>16</b></a>However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_peter/4-17.htm\"><b>17</b></a><strong>For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?</strong><a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_peter/4-18.htm\"><b>18</b></a>And,\r\n\r\n<strong>“If it is hard for the righteous to be saved,</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”</strong><sup><a href=\"http://niv.scripturetext.com/1_peter/4.htm#footnotesa\">\r\n</a></sup>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_peter/4-19.htm\"><b>19</b></a>So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.</blockquote>\r\nAt first glance it seems he is saying that it is hard for the righteous to be saved because God has such a high standard of achievement. However, this bypasses other scriptures that confirm that Christ's sacrifice well saves us apart from our works.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 7:25 \"Therefore he <strong>is able to save completely</strong> those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.\"\r\n\r\nTitus 3:5 \"he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit\"\r\n\r\nJohn 3:18 \"There is no judgment against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God's one and only Son.\"\r\n\r\nJohn 5:24 \"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.\"\r\n\r\netc...</blockquote>\r\nIf a scripture seems to contradict other clear scriptures, then we need to reevaluate how we see them. In context what is this passage talking about? \"Suffering for being a christian.\" Let's read these troubling verses.\r\n<blockquote>\"17For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?18And,\r\n\r\n“If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”</blockquote>\r\nRemember he is talking about persecution. When we hear, \"hard for the righteous to be saved,\" we think that believing in Jesus just barely makes the cut, we are still being judged for our deeds. However, I believe this \"hard\" is not referring to that. Here is a passage to illustrate.\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 11 <b><a href=\"http://bible.cc/matthew/11-28.htm\">28</a></b>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/matthew/11-29.htm\"><b>29</b></a>Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/matthew/11-30.htm\"><b>30</b></a>For <strong>my yoke is easy</strong> and <strong>my burden is light.</strong>”</blockquote>\r\nJesus did teach that is is extremely hard for an unbeliever to be saved on the basis of the law, but for those who came to him it is easy (according to our works) to be saved. Peter is not saying that Jesus has such a high standard for christians that it's hard for them to be saved. Again, this passage in 1 Peter is talking about persecution. The hard he is referring to, is the suffering of being a christian.\r\n\r\nIf being a christian and doing the right thing causes us suffering, how much more suffering do you think the sinners will receive, who ignore the gospel and live life in luxury while we suffer for doing what's right?\r\n<blockquote>\"17For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?\"</blockquote>\r\nThe \"time of judgement\" the believers are facing now, is the fact that in \"this life\" they are giving up their lives and being persecuted and subjected to hardship for their faith. Peter tells them.\r\n<blockquote><b>\"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_peter/4-15.htm\">15</a></b>If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_peter/4-16.htm\"><b>16</b></a>However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name\"</blockquote>\r\nHe is calling the judgement \"suffering\" for either doing the right or wrong thing. But he says to suffer for doing the right thing rather than the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nThen he says,\r\n<blockquote>“If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”</blockquote>\r\nThe \"hard\" is meaning \"uncomfortable (to live as one who is saved).\" Paul encourages them, that if we have it hard \"now\" (begins with us), how much more will God's judgment make it hard on those who ignore the gospel when his \"judgement is revealed to the world,\" (ends with them). \"If we suffer for doing right, how much more will they suffer for doing wrong.\" Therefore, he says to continue in your faith.\r\n<blockquote>\"So then, those who suffer according to God’s will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe phrase, \"suffer according to God's will,\" does not mean God wants you to suffer or is causing it directly. It means you are suffering for doing the right thing, it means by submitting to the good God asks of you other people may bring you trouble from that, nevertheless God asks you to do it anyways. Thus, in following God's will you encounter suffering for it. Thus this suffering is \"as it should be,\" \"according to God's will,\" not as \"a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler.\"\r\n\r\nDoes that help you to understand it? It makes more sense in context. He is saying, if we are being judged so that life is hard for us now, how much worse will it be for those who don't believe and who live doing wrong?\r\n\r\nHope this encourages you!",

This passage makes a lot more sense now.I was reminded of where Paul told Timothy that all who live Godly in Christ will suffer  persecution (2Tim.3:12). So it is like Peter is saying that being saved brings hardship, but how much more hardship will come to the unsaved. This is actually a word of encouragement. He is saying that suffering according to the will of God is suffering for your faith in Christ. The faith, not the suffering itself, is His will. Jesus said:\r\n\r\nFor I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.  For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day (John 6:38-40).\r\n\r\nSo these believers were suffering because the will of God had been performed in their lives. They were not suffering to become save or holy as some legalists might believe.",

          "content:encoded": "Christians will not be judged.\n\nEvery christian shall receive the same great, perfect reward. An inheritance and eternal life.\n\nWe will be declared to be holy and blameless not having a righteousness of our own but that which comes through christ. We will be rewarded on His righteousness not ours.\n\nThat verse in corinthians is talking about being validated as christians with a sincere ministry.\n\nEphesians and Colossians\n\nAnd now about rewards. As you know I am not against rewards, especially as a means of training our children while they are younger. But the difficulty in rewards in God is that if it is based on your behavior then that means that only some will receive it and still they are limited by how good they've been. And if you are receiving according to you works, then you cannot receive according to grace.\n<blockquote>Romans 4 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/romans/4-4.htm\"><b>4</b></a>Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation.<a href=\"http://bible.cc/romans/4-5.htm\"><b>5</b></a>However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/romans/4-6.htm\"><b>6</b></a>David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works.\"</blockquote>\nSo then the problem with rewards is they are limited to your obedience and they limit the kindness God can show you. As it is, you cannot teach that we are blessed and favored on the basis of grace and limit yourself to rewards that are well earned. Whatever is earned is not freely given. And the entire message of the Bible is not about man being able to achieve, but about God's grace superabounding in his failure through Christ. Let's see that we carry the message of the gospel into our idea of eternal rewards. If you do not, then the gospel will be of no value to you.\n\nLet's look at the few verses in the bible that speak of reward.\n\nEphesians 6 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/ephesians/6-5.htm\"><b>5</b></a>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/ephesians/6-6.htm\"><b>6</b></a>Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/ephesians/6-7.htm\"><b>7</b></a>Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men, <a href=\"http://bible.cc/ephesians/6-8.htm\"><b>8</b></a>because you know that <strong>the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does</strong>, whether he is slave or free. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/ephesians/6-9.htm\"><b>9</b></a>And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.\"\n\nAnother translation quotes this verse as\n\nEphesians 6:8 \"As you know that anything a man does which is excellent will be repaid by Our Lord, whether he is a Servant or a Freeman.\"\n\nAt first glance it seems Paul is saying that God will give us rewards for our obedience and fail to give us rewards when we do wrong. Notice Paul says the same thing in Colossians, but differently.\n\nColossians 3 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/colossians/3-22.htm\">22</a>Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to win their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/colossians/3-23.htm\"><b>23</b></a>Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, <a href=\"http://bible.cc/colossians/3-24.htm\"><b>24</b></a>since you know that you will <strong>receive an inheritance</strong> from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/colossians/3-25.htm\"><b>25</b></a>Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.\"\n\nSo in context of both of these passages, what is the reward he speaks about? An inheritance. Now is this inheritance given because of works or because we are God's children? Let's look at some verses on inheritance to find out.\n<blockquote>Ephesians 1 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/ephesians/1-13.htm\"><b>13</b></a>And you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, <a href=\"http://bible.cc/ephesians/1-14.htm\"><b>14</b></a>who is a deposit <strong>guaranteeing our inheritance</strong> until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory...\n\n<b><a href=\"http://bible.cc/ephesians/1-18.htm\">18</a></b>I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance <strong>in the saints</strong>, <a href=\"http://bible.cc/ephesians/1-19.htm\"><b>19</b></a>and his incomparably great power for us who believe.\"\n\nGalatians 3:18 \"For if the <b>inheritance</b> depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.\"\n\nColossians 1 \"<sup>12 </sup>and giving joyful thanks to <strong>the Father, who has qualified you</strong> to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light. <sup>13 </sup>For <strong>he has rescued us</strong> from the dominion of darkness and brought us into <strong>the kingdom of the Son</strong> he loves\"\n\nHebrews 9:15 \"For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal <b>inheritance</b>—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.\"\n\n1 Peter 1 \"<sup>3 </sup>Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, <sup>4 </sup>and into an <strong>inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you</strong>, <sup>5 </sup>who through faith are shielded by God’s power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.\"\n\nMatthew 25:34 \"Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, <strong>the kingdom prepared for you</strong> since the creation of the world.\"\n\nActs 20:32 \"Now I commit you to <strong>God and to the word of his grace</strong>, which can build you up and give you an <b>inheritance</b> among all those who are sanctified.\"</blockquote>\nThis inheritance is the kingdom prepared for us in heaven. It is given through God as a gift because of what Jesus did for us. When we received Jesus, the Holy Spirit came into us to guarantee that we would get that inheritance. It is not given through obedience to the law, but through a promise. Being a promise, what do you think this verse is saying?\n<blockquote>Colossians 3:24 \"since you know that you will <strong>receive an inheritance</strong> from the Lord as a reward.\"</blockquote>\nHe is not saying that your inheritance is questioned by your deeds. He is saying that since you are freely receiving so great an inheritance, serve in gratefulness counting that inheritance as His recompense for your labor so that you will not seek perfection from your earthly masters. For it is to God we must give account to and he is the one who rewards or punishes. And if you are a christian you will receive nothing but the ultimate reward, an inheritance in the kingdom of eternal life. Why does he use the word reward? Because he's speaking in a language that would have been suitable for servants. So let's look back at Ephesians 6:7-8.\n<blockquote>\"Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men,  <a href=\"http://bible.cc/ephesians/6-8.htm\"><b>8</b></a>because you know that the Lord will <strong>reward everyone for whatever good he does.\"</strong></blockquote>\nCompare it to the previous passage. He is saying you are not working in vain because it is service to the Lord. And the Lord has promised you an inheritance that should well compensate for any service you rendered him in this life. Since you know that you will indeed be well paid, serve him in gratitude. Now let's look at the end of the passage.\n<blockquote>Colossians 3:25 \"Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.\"</blockquote>\nHe is referring to how their masters are held accountable to God for doing wrong to their servants.\n<blockquote>Ephesians 6:9 \"And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.\"</blockquote>\nHe is saying that God does not see a difference between the slaves and the free and he will hold each one accountable for their actions. Of course, the punishment implied will only be given to unbelievers in accordance with the rest of the gospel. The instruction is that those who are wronged should not seek vengeance but instead let the Lord repay those who do evil. Judgment belongs to the Lord.  If the master is an unbeliever, in the day of judgement he shall receive the punishment for treating God's servants poorly. If this master is a believer and he treats his servants poorly, he will deserve punishment, but he shall not bear it because it has been laid on Christ on his behalf. The man will have \"received his penalty\" but he himself will not have suffered it. Christ took the punishment on his behalf. That is the message of the gospel.\n<blockquote>Isaiah 53:5 \"But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.\"</blockquote>\nEvery christian will be held accountable to God, but all their punishments and sins will be sent to the completed work of Christ so that they appear before God as holy and blameless.\n<blockquote>Ephesians 1:4 \"For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight.\"\n\nEphesians 5:27 \"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless\"</blockquote>\nThus in the end, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, even those who deserve it. Therefore honor his grace and receive it fully, but realize that he had to be brutally killed in order to give it to you.\n\nNow are there any other heavenly rewards that we can miss out of if we're not good enough?\n<blockquote>Ephesians 1:3 \"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing <strong>in Christ</strong>.\"</blockquote>\nWhatever heavenly blessings there are, you will receive them through Christ, not through your works.\n\n1 John 2:28 \"And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.\"\n\n1 John 4:16  \"God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/4-17.htm\"><b>17</b></a>In this way, love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/4-18.htm\"><b>18</b></a>There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.",

          "content:encoded": "(For those of you who got my email on this passage earlier, I deleted the old post and started from scratch. You are welcome to read my revised version, but the basic content is the same.)\r\n\r\nLet's look at a difficult passage of scripture.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 3:10-15 “According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation; and another builds thereon. But let each man take heed how he builds thereon. For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. But if any man builds on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble; each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is. If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward. If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.”</blockquote>\r\nWayne Jackson and Edward Hendrie posted incredible articles on this passage that I wanted to forward for those of you who've wondered about it.\r\n\r\nWayne Jackson - <a title=\"https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/875-does-1-cor-3-15-support-the-doctrine-of-eternal-security\" href=\"https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/875-does-1-cor-3-15-support-the-doctrine-of-eternal-security\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/875-does-1-cor-3-15-support-the-doctrine-of-eternal-security</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/1066-1-corinthians-3-15-saved-through-fire\" href=\"https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/1066-1-corinthians-3-15-saved-through-fire\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.christiancourier.com/articles/1066-1-corinthians-3-15-saved-through-fire</a>\r\n\r\nEdward Hendrie- <a title=\"http://www.antichristconspiracy.com/PDFDocs/2Corinthians5.pdf\" href=\"http://www.antichristconspiracy.com/PDFDocs/2Corinthians5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.antichristconspiracy.com/PDFDocs/2Corinthians5.pdf</a>\r\n\r\nI have some additional confirmation from my own studies, but I am mostly recapping what they said.\r\n\r\nFor the context of this passage we need to understand that Paul is dealing with heresies coming into the church from other teachers.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 15 \"12 But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 14 And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 4 \"19 But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have. 20 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.\"</blockquote>\r\nThese teachers were spreading heresies that had so far departed from the gospel they had lost their power to produce genuine faith. So let's tie this in with our passage of study. We must ask what is each man's work, what is the reward, what is the fire, and what are the building blocks.\r\n<h2>What, or rather who, are the building blocks?</h2>\r\nLet's look at the passaged before and after our main passage of study. Just before the passage he says,\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 3 \"5 What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task. 6 <strong>I planted the seed</strong>, <strong>Apollos watered it</strong>, but God has been making it grow. 7 So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. 8 The one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, <strong>and they will each be rewarded according to their own labor.</strong> 9 For <strong>we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nI think this begins to answer what he's talking about. Paul's work is preaching the gospel, in building up the church, and he will have a reward from it. The building blocks are the people who are impacted from his ministry (\"[you are] God's building\") and the reward is those he won over to Christ because of his preaching.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 9 \"<strong>Are you not</strong> the result of <strong>my work </strong>in the Lord? 2 Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you!\"\r\n\r\n1 Thessalonians 2:19 \"After all, what gives us hope and joy, and what will be our <strong>proud reward</strong> and crown as we stand before our Lord Jesus when he returns? <strong>It is you!</strong>\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians \"16 For when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! 17 If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me. 18 <strong>What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge</strong>, and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the gospel.\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 10 \"32 <strong>Do not cause anyone to stumble</strong>, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God— 33 even as I try to please everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, <strong>so that they may be saved</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nThese people are a church that is growing, a temple that is being preserved, a building that is being constructed with good material, a field that is being watered.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 3 \"16 Don’t you know that <strong>you yourselve<em>s</em> are God’s temple</strong> and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst? 17 If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and <strong>you together</strong> are that temple. 18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become “fools” so that you may become wise.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe 'you' is talking corporately not so much individually. If someone dismantles God's church (through spreading false doctrines that keep people from coming to the faith), God will overthrow him. So those illegitimate teachers who think they are wise by the standards of this age, must humble themselves so they do not preach against the finished work of Christ and risk building with low quality materials.\r\n\r\nWhen Paul talks about each man's work, its easy to get the idea he is talking about how righteous you have behaved. That is how many sins you have avoided and how many good deeds you did. But when he talks about the quality of each man's work, being gold, silver, straw, or wood, I believe the context shows us that he is referring to the quality of faith teacher's followers receive from their ministry. He is encouraging them to be careful how they teach so that only enduring faith may result, not vain, temporal faith (as in the idea that there is no resurrection or that Christ has not raised from the dead). If our building puts dependance back onto man's effort and works and leaves Christ behind, then we are building with low quality materials and the fires will reveal the fault in that preaching. Now the fires I suppose can refer to either the day of judgment or in the sense of the fire of persecution in this life. But either way, quality preaching, that is preaching that has its foundation in Christ, has the power to produce genuine enduring faith, and the fire will prove their faith and preaching was legitimate.\r\n\r\nThus the reward of our work is the satisfaction and honor of having so many people brought to the Lord because of our ministry. When we go to heaven there will be hundreds of people following us there because of our preaching. Its going to fill our hearts with joy. And they will be extremely grateful toward us for the rest of eternity.  It will be a joyous celebration and we will get to live with them forever. I believe this is the reward he is talking about. Thus, when our ministry teaches belief systems that drift off of the foundation of Christ and into dead works or if our own beliefs reflect that, in the final day you will find that those teachings and beliefs we held became a loss to us. That is, they never helped people genuinely believe in Christ and our own beliefs did not glorify him. You yourself are saved, but only as one being saved in the midst of a worthless ministry and labor. God is not holding you responsible for people's faith and he does not require us to all have perfect belief systems, but there is a warning that preaching must be solid and worthy of Christ.\r\n<blockquote><span style=\"line-height:1.714285714;font-style:italic;font-size:1rem;\">\"If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.”</span></blockquote>\r\nThere are some who would preach that there are certain special works you need to do in order to be saved or have a good relationship with God. Now, we must forgive these people, for they preach from their own misunderstanding of the bible, but we need to not go adrift from their preaching. Remember my article on <a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/hebrews-6/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/hebrews-6/\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 6</a>? Dead works are a good example of a faulty belief system. They keep us in the cycle of performing useless rituals that insult Christ and add nothing of value to our lives. When we drift off of the foundation of Christ, it is tempting to fall into these rituals as a means to stay right with God. However, the final day will reveal the error of those ways as we will realize the uselessness of all that insulting labor. In a sense, we will suffer the loss of our pride and realize all the effort we put into offering those rituals was a waste.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;\">He warns them not to associate with those teachers.</span>\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 15 \"33 Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.”[e] 34 Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame.\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 15 \"58 Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.\"</blockquote>\r\n<h2>Recap</h2>\r\nSo to recap,\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 3:10-15 “According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation; and another builds thereon. But let each man take heed how he builds thereon. For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. But if any man builds on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble; each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is. If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward. If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire”</blockquote>\r\nIt is a warning to teachers, that they should be careful how they preach. For if their ministry departs too far from the true gospel, their work will have been in vain. This is not to say that minor differences in understanding the gospel will keep you from being saved. There are disputable areas in the Bible. But rather that, when the basic message of Jesus being Lord, how he died for us and rose again for our sins, and how he is the son of God, gets taken out of place, the gospel looses its power.\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:0;line-height:200%;\"></p>",

          "content:encoded": "Here is a conversation I had with the Lord about eternal security which correlates with my other article <a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/06/26/eternal-security/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/06/26/eternal-security/\" target=\"_blank\">Eternal Security</a>.\r\n\r\nAs always, I don't pretend to hear God perfectly so if you come across something that doesn't seem like God, ignore it and give me grace for such mistakes. I try to hear him as accurately as possible, but from time to time I can hear something wrong.\r\n<h2>Conversation with God</h2>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">God, I would really like to study and know how secure we are eternally. I think its pretty clear that we cannot mess up our calling by works. But could a person cease believing properly to an extent that he forfeits his calling?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“I know what you are asking. Once saved, always saved, or is there a back door? I can answer this question, but if you want me to be thorough it will take some time. We can start with what it means to be saved.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Alright. I'm listening.</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“When I call somebody, especially through the preaching of the word, my spirit works in them a lasting faith that believes in the message they heard. When I find that faith in operation, usually by means of the person saying, “Jesus is Lord,” I justify that person as in correct covenant with Me. Such a declaration cannot be reversed. It is like a court case. A penalty can only be tried and punished once.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">But Lord, you require faith to be saved? Sorry. I'll let you speak.</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“When you are called, that is only the beginning. I mark you with a seal that guarantees you will receive an inheritance in the Lord. And this inheritance does not spoil. Can you loose it? No one has. You see, if you are saved based on the whims of your mind, then I must show special treatment to those who die just after giving their lives to the Lord. Such a timing guarantees they will be saved. However, if a man has been a christian for 60 years and in his final days he turns away, he would not be shown the mercy that man who received Jesus just before he died received. But Jon Paul, this leaves an important question. How do you know if you are saved?”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Lord? How?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“Works are an evidence of faith, but the do not guarantee it. Rather it is faith that guarantee's works. To answer this question, if a man denies that Jesus is Lord and that he died and rose for your sins, that man does not have the spirit in him. Such a man has never come to me. If on the other hand he believes that Jesus is the son of God and was crucified and raised from the dead for your sins, such a man has the holy spirit. Nothing can change his standing with me. The holy spirit is a deposit guaranteeing what is to come.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">What if for a time they believe you are Lord and then later decide that you are not?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“This is the issue of the Holy Spirit leaving you. The Holy Spirit will never leave you, he will be with you forever and ever. Such a man will grieve the spirit but the spirit will turn his heart and mind back to the Lord. To answer the question, that person shall be corrected, but they will not fall. The holy spirit does not give up on anybody.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">So God, what is 1 Colossians 1:23 saying? I just read it.</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“Do you believe I can give you a straight answer?”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Yes Lord. But I will ask for a scripture. God why is it so hard to reach a conclusion on the eternal security issue. I know I can talk to you about anything.</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“I am glad you are studying. Your confidence is low right now which is why you are having trouble hearing my voice. You don't know how to recognize the voice of your father. Answer me this question, when you read the scripture, what impression do you get?”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Well, I mostly get that our salvation is completely firm. But there are a few scriptures that say we can fall away.</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“I am going to take you through verse by verse till you understand what scripture is saying. But before we start I want to ask you something.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">What's that?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“Do you trust me?”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Yes Lord.</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“Turn to <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A5&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A5&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">1 Peter 1:5</a>”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Alright. I have read it.</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“What do you think it is saying?”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Well I'm not sure. I seems he's saying that God is keeping you safe from physical harm till the resurrection?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“First of all, I'm glad you are studying this topic and the Bible. It will be a great benefit to learn where you stand on this matter. Yes, that is a good interpretation. What do you think it means, through your faith?”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">That's... well... I'm afraid it means as along as we have faith God protects us?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“It means God is protecting your faith.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">Ok, I'll take your word on that.</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“This verse contains the entire mystery of eternal security.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">It does? So what if someone gives up on their faith?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“My power protects them even from that. Through faith is the means through which God protects them.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">So its saying our faith assures us of salvation and God protects us through keeping up our faith?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“A better word for it is preserve. Who through God are preserved for the salvation that is yet to be revealed.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">So what about that annoying phrase through faith? How would you translate this verse for me?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“who through your active faith are preserved therein by God's power so that you may receive the promised inheritance. It is saying God's power is what preserves your faith until the end.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">It's not the other way around? Our faith preserves God's power?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“The weight of the verse is put on God's power which results in a sustained faith unto salvation.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">So what if we did fall away?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“I can loose none that he has given me.”</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">So we are guarantee'd to endure?</p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\">“Yes, your faith is guaranteed to endure.”</p>",

There have been many times and still will be many times where I and others think we have heard God say something that He really didn't say. Learning to follow the Spirit can be messy at times. It's a messiness I've grown to accept, but it does mean we have to test and weigh what people claim is from God. Even my own messages need to be tested. 1 John 4:1 \"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.\" 1 Corinthians 14:29 \"Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.\" People are not always intentionally trying to put words in God's mouth, but sometimes in all honesty we have misunderstood. I'm very slow to call someone a false prophet. We all have a responsibility to use God's words with respect and reverently, but unless they are intentionally putting words in God's mouth I do not call them a false prophet. Yes, I believe they are sincere Christians who have good works. And then other times they may have genuinely heard from God but they misunderstand his meaning and say something other than what he meant. I gauge what I hear in my spirit. \"But the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and good deeds. It shows no favoritism and is always sincere\" (James 3:17). If it isn't merciful, not peaceful, not gentle, not pure and impartial, insincere, doesn't produce good fruit, then I usually don't accept it as God. But, when we can't tell if it's God or not, it's best to pray about the situation and let the Bible be the judge. I hope I won't mishear God's voice but I know one day I will, even in speaking publicly on this blog and I will need my readers' grace in order not to shy away from preaching about the Lord. So I would ask that you try to understand where he's coming from. I doubt he's intentionally trying to manipulate God's words, but he may or may not have misheard him. Use the Bible and the Holy Spirit within you to discern the matter.",

              "wp:comment_content": "Indeed brother Jon Paul. I agree that I shouldn't make an impression that the Bible is unreliable. Rather is to show that regardless of how reliable it is, it is notoriously hard to interpret given the lack of clarity against many things of central importance to the gospel\r\n\r\nThe Bible is not very well organized doctrinally. You've got to remember that Jesus spent his 4 books in NT without ever explicitly telling us his expectations regarding eternal salvation or lack of it after the cross. \r\n\r\nThe second problem is again, ambiguous verses that could be interpreted both ways. Take Jesus' future prophecy about cutting down \"trees that do not bear fruit\". Law preachers say that arguments about rightly dividing the testaments don't apply here because Jesus is explicitly making a statement regarding the future. On one hand fruit never refers to grace in the Bible, on the other hand the grace preachers counter with \"a good tree has no bad fruit-so don't bring works into it if you even have 1 fruit that is bad\". On one hand we have Jesus' massive acts of forgiveness in the apostles' books that seem to prove eternal salvation, but the law preachers counter that every one of them-the adulterer-the tax collector, Peter who denied Christ, etc actually repented after their wrongs while many Christians can't really stop sinning. We have grace preachers countering that Jesus was a \"friend of the sinners and drunkards\" which probably means he never interfered with their ways in life and that his forgiveness is unconditional. Then we have law preachers citing the example of Simon the Sorcerer-he was referred to as \"among the believers\" yet he was not immune to Paul's curse of \"rot with your money because you sought to buy the Holy Spirit with money. \r\n\r\nAnother problem with radical grace's assumption of \"rightly dividing the testaments\" is this-unjustified ambiguity of the evidence of that assumption. Sure, Jesus ate with Zaccheaus, but it was not until Zaccheus promised to give back the money that Jesus said \"today you are saved\". Sure, Jesus exaggerated the law to the Pharisees, but if that is the purpose why did he exaggerate the law to disciples too? I.e. \"if any of you do not forgive, my father will not forgive you\", \"deny my name and I will deny yours in front of the father\". \r\n\r\nMy problem with \"trusting the Bible\" on matters like these this-the ones that say it so confidently are the ones who get stumped on my questions all the time. I'm not demeaning the Bible-I'm saying that if anyone boasts that it is clear and easy to interpret, they ought to competently answer my questions. \r\n\r\nSure, it is easy to have faith in the Bible if one barely read it and just ignore the scary verses, but then again that's not faith. That's just confidence ignited by foolishness and indifference or luck.\r\n\r\nAlso, Joseph Prince makes a lot of mistakes.\r\n\r\nThe journey in the desert-he says it was pure grace. But God got angry and allowed snakes to bite Israel until the bronze snake was carved. But was the snake given until repentance is given? Repentance did not come before the snake, it came after the snake.\r\n\r\nHe says that the law was given rather than Abraham's promise because man boasted to serve God. Yet it was God that first said \"obey my laws and I will be your God\" before Israel uttered \"we will\". Obviously it was God that brought it up first.\r\n\r\nPrince says that grace was upon Abraham, but that was earned by obedience to sacrifice his son wasn't it?\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is this-there are many parts of the Bible that we can trust. But on eternal security it is hard to generate trust because the arguments and counters and degree of ambiguity is too high. Once in a while someone like Joseph claims to write a \"refute the opposition once and for all\" book and the dummies who never read their Bible cheer on, but people like me are smart enough to realize that Joseph only dared to stick to Paul's writings instead of commenting on the harsh implications of James, Jude and Revelations, and even within Paul's writings he did not explain what \"the fear of the Lord\" is in Acts. Apparently he brushes it aside with \"fear means reverence in Hebrew\". But then where does the \"work out your salvation with fear and trembling come from\"? The word \"trembling\" he does not dare touch on. Timothy 5:8's comment on \"worse than unbelievers\" he does not dare touch on. \r\n\r\nAnd yes, Paul said in Romans \"believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you are saved\". But he also said somewhere else \"confess Jesus with your mouth and believe in your heart and you are saved\". And then James started saying \"the believers will be recognized by their fruit\". Each one of these statements is incremental in its demands. Law preachers complain about us arbitrarily accepting the first without accepting the second (for those who do not dare to tell people they are Christians). And that's true. \r\n\r\nSo then, what would I do in my case? I'd obviously go for someone with personal revelation since technical analysis clearly isn't working. But how do I know you are legit? 1) People don't just naturally imagine things like \"search up 1st Peter 1:5\" when they don't even know what that verse is. Many people who claim to talk to God only gets \"yes or no\" answers, but you got answers that require explanation and intellectual analysis. If you can shoot an arrow into space and make it travel forever, you may be 50/50 certain that it will reach a star. But to tell me which star it will land on is a feat to be reckoned with. 2) Many people who claim to talk to God anytime they want but cringe in fear when I ask them to reveal something about me. Why are they so scared if they claim to talk to God? 3) Many people who talk to God couldn't give an explanation at all about how they know it's an external source and not self-produced feelings or convos in the head-at least you talk about the details of the process 4) People who talk about God often don't have objective evidence to back stuff up-but stuff you talk about-eg \"anger is just a different frequency of sadness\"-how can you possibly dream up something that profound in your own mind? 5) Many people who claim to \"speak to God\" aren't stoked at all-I mean, how can you not be excited if you really can? You can ask them about all sorts of mysteries of the world-next week's lotto number, black eyed kids phenomenon...etc. Ok God probably withhold's the lotto numbers since he's not supposed to create massive physical interference on earth, but still, why aren't they excited if they can talk to God? And thinking about lotto randomly, why wouldn't God tell us lotto numbers if we asked? After all Job had 5000 sheep and Solomon's palace was supposedly worth $60 billion in our time. \r\n\r\nSee, you meet all the right criteria. Although I'm a bit surprised you, your cousin and Conrad all got \"science\"-ish answers, I don't doubt you. You dared to attempt it with no fear-unlike the Christians I've met who would bring all sorts of excuses to stop me from testing them like that. After all it could even have been a demon trying to cram \"science\" in all three of your minds-you, your cousin and Conrad, to dissuade me from the true gospel.",

But I am not capable of testing the spirit, for I cannot work out the apparent contradictions behind the many Biblical verses. Also, I have not sensed the Holy Spirit for a long time. I cannot distinguish between \"the right message\" or just \"me feeling happy\". \r\n\r\nBut can you do something similar to the \"15 pencils test\" to ask something for my sake? I am encouraged by your words but still a little scared inside. Can you ask God if I am saved forever? And also tell me what exam I have today? If you get it  right it will help me trust the Lord. If you can't get the answer I will not judge you. It is for my own sake that I ask this, not in my enjoyment of excessive testing and being a nuisance. I know God may not respond at demand, but you seem to be one who can talk with him for great lengths at a time. Can you please try it? I am shaken by the law preachers' testimonies. Please my brother. You said you can talk to the Lord even about mundane things like how computer pixels work. How much more then, is it worthy of a response when a person like me is cringing over their life and has not heard a single word from him in so many years? Have pity on me. If an apostle in the Bible believed in the Lord because he saw him behind the fig tree, can I not have a miraculous confirmation as well?",

              "wp:comment_content": "I understand and you have my compassion!!! \n\nIt can be true that we can believe words came from God because they make us feel good when actually they haven't come from God. But more often than not we dismiss something God has told us that is good news because we think it's too good. The Gospel itself means, \"Good News.\" \n\nI will talk to God about your situation! Remember, I don't always hear perfectly, there can be times where I hear one sentence right but the next incorrectly. This is because just as the Holy Spirit lives in me, so my own spirit lives within me and has its' own thoughts. I know God will respond, \"If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you\" (James 1:5). \n\nI am not bothered by your request, I have found myself in the same situation before. I am worried however that I may hear incorrectly, but if you give me your grace I will take the risk of hearing Him wrong. I only ask if I do hear Him wrong at this point that you would not dismiss all hope of hearing God or believing your Salvation is secure. I firmly believe you are secure even if I hear incorrectly at times. \n\nI asked the Lord what exam you were taking tomorrow and I felt like I heard \"Science\" and then later \"Chemistry.\" For confirmation I talked to my prophetic relative and my best friend Conrad who prophecies quite a bit. My relative at once heard \"Physics.\" Conrad also heard \"Physics\" but second to that he heard \"Chemistry or Science.\" \n\nBoth Conrad and I heard that you were eternally secure. I was told that just as surely as a person cannot go back into the womb and be unborn, so you cannot reverse your salvation. Once you are justified by faith the case is sealed. It cannot be retried. God's reputation as upholding justice depends on it. \n\nConrad also heard that you have been given a new nature that is irreversible, however he feels that your mind has not been renewed to the reality of your situation and is still thinking carnally. He wants you to know for sure you are eternally secure. \n\nFinally I felt like the Lord told me some other things.\n\nLord, what do you want to say to Simon?\n“Tell Him I know his worries, that he wants to serve my will and that he does not have confidence that he can hear my voice. But I am in Him and I will give Him confidence to trust in my peace. Salvation is eternal because it relies on Christ and not what test you have today. I am glad he is seeking for help and wants to know what I have to say. Tell him I will be speaking to Him regularly. \n\nGod wanted me to look up your name's meaning and it said, “He has heard.” I believe God wants you to know that He hears your distress and he is providing hope for you!\n\nHope this helps! I know I am taking a large risk, but I hope this is what you needed to hear.",

How do we know that the \"voice\" that these believers say that they heard was really God?  How do we know that the voice they heard was not an evil spirit?  Or Satan?  Or just the person's own conscience talking?\r\n\r\nWe know that the voice was God's because the Bible, God's Word, tells us that it was!\r\n\r\nCould God give personal revelations today to individual believers?  Sure!  He's God!  But the New Testament is clear that the WORD \"is our guide\", and a \"lamp to our feet\", not internal voices.\r\n\r\nUnless God has included your private revelation in the Bible, there is no way to know for sure who's voice you are listening to in your heart.  God?  Maybe.  Satan?  Maybe.  YOU?  Probably.\r\n\r\n\"Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.\"\r\n\r\nWant to know God's will for you today and everyday?  Read your Bible!  And by the way, don't sit around and expect God to make all your decisions in life.  Just as in the Parable of the Talents, our Lord has given us each \"talents\" to use wisely.  He gives you the general principles to follow in his Word, but he wants YOU to make the wise decisions and make the wise \"investments\".\r\n\r\nWaiting for God to make every decision for you in your life is a recipe for anxiety and depression.\r\n\r\nCling to the Word, not to internal voices, my Christian brother!",

              "wp:comment_content": "Brother, everyone knows to cling to the word, but how is it useful when interpreting the Word is extra hard? I'd rather trust internal voices when I've got myself stuck in a crack on Biblical interpretation.\r\n\r\nFirstly there is the fact of overwhelming numerosity-endless circles of debates are written on the eternal security topic. Whose thesis are you going to trust when you see the Bible as contradictory and don't know where you've interpreted it wrongly? \r\n\r\nMany people who are so quick to say \"rely on the word\" doesn't realize that eternal security isn't something a 2 page internet rant or a 200 page pdf could solve convincingly. It would take maybe 2000 pages to clear the argument from both sides, which is complicated because each side has some classic verses the other avoids discussing\r\n\r\nEven worse is the problem of ambiguity of context. Many verses can be interpreted in light of both  the side of demand and that of grace, so biblical scholars are relying on \"what could be\" to shove themselves out of the cracks. But simply proving what \"could be\" doesn't guarantee that that a verse positively supports a doctrine. \r\n\r\nTake the \"don't mix new wine with old wineskin\". Law preachers say that Jesus meant to say that once you have accepted Christ you need to put your old habits away, and grace preachers say that the old and new don't mix refers to the two covenants. Who is right? Hard to tell. \r\n\r\nOr Matthew 7:21. Grace preachers say that the \"will of my father\" refers to \"believe in Christ\", but that seems to be going in circles as we forget that those people condemned already did address Jesus as \"Lord\" before they were condemned. \r\n\r\nOr the lukewarm Christians in Revelations that Jesus said he will spit out of his mouth. Who is it? It's hard to know who they even are. If this is about sinners, lukewarm should be better than cold. But if this is about mixing law with grace, why would those who mix law with grace be spitten out since \"cold\" by analogy should refer to Pharisee-like people who think of keeping the whole law, while they are implicated to still be accepted by Jesus?\r\n\r\nIf you think you can answer all of these questions and around 33 extras, I'll happily pile them onto you so you can solve it for me and tell me which parts of the Word I can trust. But if not, and that applies to some preachers whom I consulted who got stumped, you better not stand on the sidelines and say \"read the Word\" as if it's an easy task.\r\n\r\nI admit JonPaul got my exam wrong today-it wasn't science-it's law. But so what? It could have easily been due to mental suggestion from my mention of pixels, or from the fact that he speaks to God about science all the time. But he would seriously have to be a serious hallucinator to come up with searching my name in Hebrew and telling me it means \"He has heard\". If he were demon possessed and wanted to preach the false doctrine to me, demon would have made sure he got my exam subject right. But the Lord said through him \"it is by Christ and not what your exam is that you are saved\".",

              "wp:comment_content": "Response to Simon:\r\n\r\nYou have pointed out a very important issue (and very BIG problem) in evangelical theology.  Not only do evangelicals believe that God tells them in their hearts who to marry, which job to take, what city to live in, which church to attend, and divine personalized guidance in every other aspect of life, evangelicals believe that God reveals to them in their hearts, the true interpretation of Scripture.  Problem is, God seems to give a different interpretation of Scripture to every individual evangelical Christian!  Thus the plethora of evangelical denominations and sects with varying doctrines and beliefs.\r\n\r\nI am not going to tell you what my opinion is on the issue of eternal security.  But here is my suggestion on how you and every Christian can learn the true Christian position on this issue:  Read all the passages of Scripture that discuss this issue, both those that seem to support \"once saved, always saved\" and those that seem to support that a true believer, a true Christian, CAN turn his back on Christ, abandon his faith, and lose his salvation.\r\n\r\nOnce you have looked at all these verses, take a look at the beliefs on this issue of the Early Christians.  What did the Christians of the first four centuries after Christ believe on this doctrine?  I know that many Baptists and evangelicals believe that the true Faith ceased to exist after the last Apostle died, but how can that be true when God said that the gates of Hell would not prevail against his Church?\r\n\r\nThe early Christians had a very clear position on this issue.  I suggest you look into it.  The writings of the early Christian do NOT have the same level of authority of Scripture, but their writings can help us to understand how the disciples of the Apostles understand the passages of Scripture that discuss \"eternal security\".\r\n\r\nMartin Luther taught that the Bible is the only SUPREME authority.  Tradition, Church councils and popes do not have the same authority as Scripture.  However, Luther did NOT teach that the writings of the early Christians have NO authority.  This is the mistake that many evangelicals make.  They disregard all the copious writings of the early Christians, and instead listen for a voice inside them to tell them what this 2,000 old document, written in ancient languages, in a Middle Eastern culture, means to say.",

              "wp:comment_content": "Gary, you make some good points. I understand the respect that needs to be present when we talk about hearing from God and how if we don't handle it correctly it can lead to problems. I myself spend a lot of time preparing people for some of the unexpected difficulties that arise when learning to hear from God. You have listed many reasons why the \"God speaks to me\" card can be misused. But, have you not considered the good that also comes through hearing God's voice?\r\n\r\nI know a man who was told by God to stand on his head in front of a drink machine at a gas station. Three times the man refused to listen by finally he pulled over his car and stood on his head in front of the station drink machine. The worker behind the counter began to cry, so my friend who has stood on his head went over to the guy and asked him what was going on. Well twenty minutes earlier, a christian had come into the store and talked to the worker about giving his life to the Lord. The man refused to and said, \"The day a man stands on his head in front of that cooler will be the day I give my life to God.\"\r\n\r\nBecause this man heard the personal voice of God inside and stood on his head, that worker gave his life to Christ! He is now a saved Christian. \r\n\r\nI have seen dozens of people's lives encouraged and changed because of words God has given me for others as well as many stories from my friends who lead people to the Lord or healed people with sicknesses or infirmities through following the voice of the spirit. \r\n\r\nI do agree and throughly understand your point that hearing God's voice can have be messy, but I believe the risk is worth it. So much good comes from hearing God that it outweighs the problems we may or may not have.\r\n\r\nI like that you don't want people's lives to be frozen and confused in waiting for God to say something, and I like that you want to Bible to be our chief authority and you even recommend reading the early apostles writings to help understand the scriptures. I have no debates with you over that. \r\n\r\nI think what I hear you saying is that we shouldn't try to hear from God because it isn't provable and reliable and people have the opportunity to use that weakness however they want. \r\n\r\nHave you ever heard the story of the boy who cried wolf? A shepard boy pretended two times that wolves were attacking when he was actually safe. However, the third time some wolves did really attack, but because the people thought he was joking they did not come to help and the flock was eaten. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in your experience when people have said, \"God told me,\" they have been like the shepard boy who was bored and looking for attention. And you have become like one of the townspeople who no longer counts on those words because they have been so misused. However, you may find that one day (which I would say is everyday) God is really going to speak something important and if you are not willing to listen, you may miss out on some opportunities and wonderful things God has for your life. I am sure God will find some other ways to reach you, but when you cut off communication with God, you miss out on the core privilege of your faith, a relationship with Him. \r\n\r\nYes, hearing God's voice is dangerous, messy, and abused. You cannot always prove what you hear and people can pretend what they want. But God is a God who works in the midst of such chaos and works everything out in conformity with his will. When we learn to cooperate with Him and learn to listen and know Him, we enter into the greatest adventure of life!",

              "wp:comment_content": "Brother, I have thought about digging through the writings of early church history. They are no use to me-even more contradictions than the Bible. I'd need around 2000 pages of research to try to be convinced biblically without the Holy Spirit. Do you not understand how complex this debate is? Tonnes of books have been pushed into this subject, refuted, re-refuted and so on.\r\n\r\nAnd the major problem again, is ambiguity. Context hardly helps to determine what Jesus meant about those who \"turn away\" when troubles come. It could mean physically, it could mean spiritually lost forever, but what's the right interpretation? Or again, does the parable of the thorns refer to those whose faith are not prospering them on earth, or does it mean eternal damnation? Everyone says \"context is the key\" but really, knowing that he's talking to the disciples under a tree after riding a donkey etc-that's not gonna help you interpret these vague scriptures. Game over. No more information. Everyone just interprets these shady scriptures the way they like merely on the basis that it could be interpreted in such a way without expressly being refuted. But this is easy to do. The Bible is so vague that many things can be interpreted in drastically coincidental ways. Know the occultist Edgar Cayce? He interpreted the whole book of Revelation with eastern spirituality and chakra philosophy and it still looked quite profoundly legit, although it's not.\r\n\r\nWe're normal people with things to do. I for one can't be stuffed doing any further research on what the Bible says. I'm not lazy-I know more Bible than all my friends combined and yet I'm hopeless on the subject. How am I going to study? Put in 8 hours more a day to seek an answer?\r\n\r\nAnd another grace blogspot has something to say about the early church as well http://pureunadulteratedgrace.blogspot.co.nz/2011/09/early-church-history-is-proof-against.html \r\nI think he has a point, especially that even Universalism was widely accepted among the early Church, how then can we trust them on matters of salvation?\r\n\r\nEvery evangelist does interpret scripture differently, but I test those who claim to have spoken to God. You got to remember that just because evangelists have different doctrines, it doesn't mean that their interpretation was inspired by the Holy Spirit. JonPaul's detailed descriptions of how God speaks and the beauty of the messages captivated me. A lot of other people who claim to \"speak to God\" don't even bother explaining what it feels like. A lot of people claim that they have a great personal relationship about God and know for sure they are told by God they are saved, but when I ask them to do a favour and ask God if I'm saved they shiver and stumble. They clearly aren't so sure they speak to God as they boast!\r\n\r\nI feel that JonPaul isn't making this up. He has nothing to gain here if he were. Working for demons? Then his website should be way more expansive than just a personal blog-there's plenty of ways to attract more readers without being an inconspicuous spot on the internet, read by online stalkers like us who pay him no prestige, no marketing and no money. Talking about inconspicuousness, it's surprising how hard it is to find this place. I've been researching for months and only ended up here by luck. Or is he trolling? With long words like these that tire himself more than me? Out of pride? If so, why does he constantly admit he mishears stuff? Out of imagination? Then who revealed the science stuff to him? His piece on emotions was more profound than what many psychology students who have studied emotions for years could write. Also, it's easy to imagine sentences, but paragraph after paragraph, active imperatives as well? I don't think JonPaul is fake. I think he's legit. \r\n\r\nYou say that the internal voices are best not to be trusted. I agree, on the basis that it would be reasonably possible for one to reach a conclusion based on the Bible. But if I can't, then listening to internal voices don't really have a much higher probability of making me more wrong or confused than I already am. After all, you're stuck with a coin flipping probability either way for both options.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Holy Spirit is supposed to be no less talkative than Jesus. Jesus said \"it is good that I am leaving you, otherwise the Holy Spirit will not come\". JonPaul seems to fit this scripture. The Holy Spirit should be a discernable force for the Christian. Most of us are treating the Holy Spirit like Ron Weasley's rat Scabbers who does nothing but stay and sleep, even as the hypocrites cry \"Christianity is a relationship, not a religion\".",

              "wp:comment_content": "Thank you Simon. I do agree that the Bible is unclear at times, but I hope we aren't leaving the tone that it's altogether unreliable. There are scriptures that are pretty clear and lots of people can agree on. But the Holy Spirit is the one who should guide our reading, especially in tricky passages. And I appreciate that you think of me as valid. There may come a time when more research is done and large portions of what I felt came from the Lord is false. Then again, further research may confirm the things I felt I heard. I have had drastic instances of hearing the Lord wrong in my life along with drastic instances of hearing Him right. So why do I risk something so unstable? Why would I write what I feel like the Lord is saying if I can't prove it?\r\n\r\nBecause even if you mishear God 3 out of 4 times, that 1 time of hearing correctly is worth it. God's words change people's lives and gives them purpose, peace, and life. I have found this as a key to enjoying my christian walk and I hope others will see my boldness as inspiration to learn to hear from God themselves. I don't have any special qualifications. I once struggled to hear even the most basic things, and I still struggle from time to time. I have no degrees in theology, just a passion to know God. Nor am I always a humble person. Christ's love keeps me humble and bold but there are times where I stumble. There is not anything I have that anyone else may have. God doesn't speak to me because I am an 'ideal christian' or someone who 'seeks Him' all the time. He speaks to me because he is my father and I am his son and we are meant to know each other. Likewise I believe he will speak to anyone who is willing to listen.\r\n\r\nI want you to be comforted, encouraged, and inspired about the things God says, but don't take everything I claim God said as unquestionable truth. There have been times in my past where I felt strongly that I heard the Lord say something and a year later, I realized was actually not Him. And there have been times where even in the same paragraph I realized I had heard some details correct and others incorrect. I am still working on learning to recognize my own thoughts from His.\r\n\r\nI am sorry I did not hear correctly about your class and I'm glad you still have confidence that God wants you to be secure. I have prayed that you begin to hear the Lord's voice for yourself too! And I would be happy to ask the Lord what more he wants to say to you perhaps over email.",

Not that pastors don't, but most of them are just \"hey come and purchase my dvd\" or otherwise saying \"God talks to you\" while never bothering to give an example themselves. I don't know what I should ask God. I have many curiosities...alien...demons...possessions...black eye kids...biblical verses...swords...architecture of heaven...next week's lotto number...how the new jerususalem can be as tall as it is wide etc but don't worry I'm not going to do that to you hahaha. \r\n\r\nI would be happy if you asked the Lord if I can join the Battle of Armageddon, whether the rapture is pre-tribulation or post tribulation, whether I can have a sword to keep for the rest of eternity and a new name.",

I went online and found a lot of websites that talk about hearing God's voice and none of them gave me any kind of answer, just more rabbit trails.  More goose hunts.\r\n\r\nI was recently in a relationship with a man for a couple of months that I grew to care for very deeply.  He broke up with me and when he did the reasons he gave didn't make sense.  The only sense I could make out of it was that he had been stolen.\r\n\r\nBefore that things had been a little rocky and I heard Joseph Prince say three times that if we are having problems in our relationships we should talk to God not other people, but I was talking to my friends trying to do the best I could in the situation.  I was a man trusting in his own strength.\r\n\r\n“Cursed is the man who trusts in man\r\nAnd makes flesh his strength,\r\nWhose heart departs from the Lord.\r\n6 For he shall be like a shrub in the desert,\r\nAnd shall not see when good comes,\r\nBut shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,\r\nIn a salt land which is not inhabited.\r\n\r\nThat was all over 2 months ago now.  Since that time I've had my hope encouraged that God would bring him back, but then I lose faith and hope because of what scripture says about these kinds of relationships.  But every time I think I need to give up and let go and move on, my heart cries and rather than hardening myself to it I wait and a song, or a message, a devotional or a message from Joseph Prince gives me hope that God may not be done with it all yet.\r\n\r\nThe guy who broke up with me is an atheist.  He won't talk to me anymore.  We used to have a great time together watching movies, playing video games, laughing.  He was my best friend and I liked sending him funny pictures to make him laugh.  And then he was just gone.  Like someone came along and stole him away from me.  And I know it wasn't God because I kept feeling like God was saying talk to me and instead I was talking to my friends.  \r\n\r\nI found your website because I was searching on how to hear God again and I'm going to try to listen more to what goes on inside of me after reading your blog about it.  I also read the three parts of what hinders prayers.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I didn't really know I would write all this, but just felt compelled to say something after the things you shared because right now I don't have many friends with faith or belief in the kind of grace you wrote about, most of my friends don't have anything at all to do with church.  As for me, my church consists of watching Joseph Prince sunday mornings.

I prayed.  I cried.  I prayed some more.  I cried some more.  I went online and found a lot of websites that talk about hearing God's voice and none of them gave me any kind of answer, just more rabbit trails.  More goose hunts.\r\n\r\nI was recently in a relationship with a man for a couple of months that I grew to care for very deeply.  He broke up with me and when he did the reasons he gave didn't make sense.  The only sense I could make out of it was that he had been stolen.\r\n\r\nBefore that things had been a little rocky and I heard Joseph Prince say three times that if we are having problems in our relationships we should talk to God not other people, but I was talking to my friends trying to do the best I could in the situation.  I was a man trusting in his own strength.\r\n\r\n“Cursed is the man who trusts in man\r\nAnd makes flesh his strength,\r\nWhose heart departs from the Lord.\r\n6 For he shall be like a shrub in the desert,\r\nAnd shall not see when good comes,\r\nBut shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,\r\nIn a salt land which is not inhabited.\r\n\r\nThat was all over 2 months ago now.  Since that time I've had my hope encouraged that God would bring him back, but then I lose faith and hope because of what scripture says about these kinds of relationships.  But every time I think I need to give up and let go and move on, my heart cries and rather than hardening myself to it I wait and a song, or a message, a devotional or a message from Joseph Prince gives me hope that God may not be done with it all yet.\r\n\r\nThe guy who broke up with me is an atheist.  He won't talk to me anymore.  We used to have a great time together watching movies, playing video games, laughing.  He was my best friend and I liked sending him funny pictures to make him laugh.  And then he was just gone.  Like someone came along and stole him away from me.  And I know it wasn't God because I kept feeling like God was saying talk to me and instead I was talking to my friends.  \r\n\r\nI found your website because I was searching on how to hear God again and I'm going to try to listen more to what goes on inside of me after reading your blog about it.  I also read the three parts of what hinders prayers.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I didn't really know I would write all this, but just felt compelled to say something after the things you shared because right now I don't have many friends with faith or belief in the kind of grace you wrote about, most of my friends don't have anything at all to do with church.

          "content:encoded": "I have been teaching how it's a good idea to read a book from beginning to end in one sitting to help bring out the context. Well, last night I read a large portion of Romans but not the full book because it got to be too late. I wanted to write a post on my reflections from the book. There are a few different ways of interpreting certain scriptures, but I will share the interpretation I am examining.\r\n\r\nAfter his greetings, he sympathizes with the Jewish ideas of Gentiles. That they have rejected the knowledge of God and sought their own ways. However in Romans 2 he points the finger back at the Jews saying,\r\n<blockquote>Therefore you have no excuse <i>or </i>defense <i>or</i> justification, O man, whoever you are who judges <i>and</i> condemns another. For in posing as judge <i>and</i> passing sentence on another, you condemn yourself, because you who judge are habitually practicing the very same things [that you censure and denounce]. (Romans 2:1)</blockquote>\r\nHe warns them, that if they have confidence in their flesh (that they uphold the law) they are no better. They are showing contempt for God's kindness to the gentiles not realizing that God's kindness is leading them to repentance. They want the gentiles to be judged.\r\n\r\nPaul then says,\r\n<blockquote>For He will render to every man according to his works [justly, as his deeds deserve]: To those who by patient persistence in well-doing [springing from piety] seek [unseen but sure] glory and honor and [the eternal blessedness of] immortality, He will give eternal life. But for those who are self-seeking <i>and </i>self-willed <i>and</i> disobedient to the Truth but responsive to wickedness, there will be indignation and wrath. (Romans 2:6-8)</blockquote>\r\nThis is the just judgment of God that falls on all human beings alike because of sin. However later in Romans, Paul talks about how God's gift of righteousness protects us from this wrath. It seems to me he is showing us the danger we are in and the humility we are in apart from Christ's forgiveness.\r\n\r\nPaul talks about how God is impartial, judging both Jews and Gentiles alike. However, in this day the Jews felt a sense of superiority over the Gentiles because they had been entrusted with God's commandments. But Paul says, you who boast in the law, do you do what it says? For even if the gentiles who do not have the law do what it says, their consciences bearing witness, they will condemn you who have the law yet don't practice it! He says, having pride in your law is pointless if you don't keep it!\r\n\r\nFor being a Jew is not a person who is one outwardly, but who is one inwardly.\r\n\r\nSo then his audience raises a question? Then do Jews have any advantage over gentiles? Is there any special benefits to being a Jew?\r\n\r\nPaul says that they have much favor, to begin with they were entrusted with the words of God!  This next part gets confusing for me. He says,\r\n<blockquote>What if some did not believe <i>and</i> were without faith? Does their lack of faith <i>and </i>their faithlessness nullify <i>and</i> make ineffective <i>and</i> void the faithfulness of God <i>and</i> His fidelity [to His Word]? By no means! Let God be found true though every human being is false <i>and</i> a liar, as it is written, That You may be justified <i>and</i> shown to be upright in what You say, and prevail when You are judged [by sinful men]. (Romans 3:3-4)</blockquote>\r\nI suppose what he is saying in this passage is that, did God not stop entrusting and favoring the Jews because some of them did not follow God. Despite the Jew's lack of faithfulness to their Creator, God's mercy and election was made all the more evident. God was bound by his word so that he could not remove the promises he had given the Jews, even though they betrayed him.\r\n\r\nTherefore this audience says, \"Well if my sin serves to bring out God's unstoppable faithfulness why am I being judged?\" They are angry with Paul because they think he is saying that we should do evil that God's goodness towards us may result. Paul says this is not what he teaches and they rightly condemn such beliefs.\r\n\r\nThen they ask, \"Are we Jews better off than the gentiles?\"\r\n\r\nPaul says no, because all men alike are under sin. Therefore the law silences all of us and holds us accountable to God.\r\n\r\nNo man can be made righteous through their human obedience, for the real function of the law was to help people see how sinful they were and make them conscious of sin!\r\n\r\nBut now, God has provided a righteousness completely apart from the law although the law and prophets testify to it.\r\n\r\nBy trusting and relying on Jesus Christ we are freely given this righteousness.\r\n\r\nWe have all sinned and now are justified, made up upright, and in right standing with God completely and only because of his grace.\r\n\r\nGod sent his son, to show his justice. For he had not punished our sins knowing that he would one day punish them in Christ. Thus by punishing Christ, God has justly condemned sin while at the same time justifying the sinner. He remains an honorable judge who can show unlimited mercy to us.\r\n\r\nPaul then says, so what makes a Jew better than a gentile anymore? Nothing! For man is now justified by faith alone apart from good deeds. Is God merely a God of the Jews or Gentiles also?\r\n\r\nIt is God who justifies the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised by their newly acquired faith. (Circumcision was a distinguishing mark of the Jew).\r\n\r\nThen he says, \"Do we therefore make the law worthless by this faith? No! We are actually serving it's purpose!\" The law was not made to justify man, but to hold us accountable to God so that we would come to Christ for justification. By coming to Christ for justification, we are actually fulling what the law was truly intended to do.\r\n\r\nAbraham himself was not justified by works but by faith. For when he believed God, God counted him as righteous. Now when someone works, his wages are not counted as a gift or favor but as an obligation. But to those who do not work but trust God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited to them for righteousness (as a gift).\r\n\r\nThus David congratulates the man and blesses those whom God gives righteousness apart from works. \"Blessed <i>and</i> happy <i>and</i> to be envied are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered up <i>and</i> completely buried.  Blessed <i>and</i> happy <i>and</i> to be envied is the person of whose sin the Lord will take no account <i>nor</i> reckon it against him.\" (Romans 4:7-8).\r\n\r\nWhat I learned from this, is that God will never count your sin against you or even take it into account anymore!\r\n\r\nPaul writes, was this blessing meant only to Jews (the circumcised)? Or also the gentiles  (the uncircumcised)?\r\n\r\nAbraham's faith made him righteous, was this before or after he was circumcised? If it was after he was circumcised, then justification would only belong to the Jews. It was not after, but before! He received the mark of circumcision as an evidence and seal of the righteousness he had while he was still uncircumcised. This means he is the father of all, both Jew and Gentile, who receive righteousness by faith.\r\n\r\nLater Paul explains that this is symbolic of the Holy Spirit.  We have received righteousness for believing in Christ, and the Holy Spirit circumcises our hearts by dwelling within us and destroying the sinful nature. He is a seal of the righteousness we've been given.\r\n\r\nFor God's promise to Abraham that he would be an heir of the world did not come through obeying the law, but through the righteousness of faith. For if the promises of God come to those who earn them by the obey the law, then faith is made worthless! What value does faith in the Christ's blood have if you must earn God's promises through works? God's promises could never be fulfilled as a gift because no one can do enough good to earn them! Rather our attempts at human made righteousness only incur wrath! But if there is no law, then there is nothing to discredit you from freely receiving the promises!\r\n\r\nThose words, 'it was accredited to him' was not written to him alone, but for our sakes too! For we all receive this gift of righteousness when we believe in Christ. For Christ was put to death because of our misdeeds and raised to secure our justification, absolving us from all guilt before God.\r\n\r\nTherefore, since we are justified (absolved of guilt) and God is no longer taking account of our sins, let us grasp that fact and enjoy the peace we have in being reconciled to God through Christ! Through him we have unlimited access by this faith into God's unmerited favor in which we firmly stand. And let us be excited in the hope of experiencing and enjoying the glory of God!\r\n\r\nMoreover, let us be full of joy now! Even in our sufferings, knowing that persecution shows our unwavering patience and that patience proves our faith is real. And this assurance of faith produces a joyful and confident hope! Such a hope never disappoints us because the Holy Spirit is in us, testifying that we are God's children through pouring God's love into our hearts!\r\n\r\nFor while we were still powerless to overcome sin, at the fitting time, Christ died for all the ungodly.\r\n\r\nThis is an extraordinary thing! For who gives up his life even for an upright man? Though if the man was noble, lovable and generous someone might even dare to die.\r\n\r\nBut God shows and proves his love for us by the fact that when we were at our worst, being controlled by sin, Jesus died for us.\r\n\r\nTherefore since we are currently justified by Christ's blood, how much more certain is it that we shall be saved through him from the wrath of God?\r\n\r\nIf while we were enemies of God we were saved, how much more now that we are reconciled to God shall we be saved through his life!?\r\n\r\nNot only this, but we also glory in God's love and perfection through  Jesus Christ whom we have now received and enjoy reconciliation.\r\n\r\nSin was introduced to the world though one man, Adam, and death (condemnation) as a result of that sin. So death spread to all men and no one could escape it's power. Sin was in the world before the law was given, but it was not taken into account. Yet, even those who did not break a commandment of God were condemned. Adam was a symbol of Christ, he being destructive, but Christ saving!\r\n\r\nBut God's free gift of righteousness is not even on the same scale as Adam's sin! For many died because of man's offense but much more profusely does God's grace and free gift of undeserved favor that comes through one man Christ abound and overflow for the benefit of many!\r\n\r\nNor is Adam's condemnation to be compared with Christ's justification. For Adam was condemned for one single sin, but Christ justifies us despite many sins!\r\n\r\nFor just as through Adam's sin, everyone was condemned, much more surely those who receive God's unmerited favor and free gift of righteousness shall reign as kings in life!\r\n\r\nThe law came in only to increase our condemnation and stir up our sinful nature, but where sin increased God's grace has greatly surpassed it! Just as sin reigned in condemnation, so God's favor reigns through the gift of righteousness which results in eternal life through Jesus.\r\n\r\nWait a second... does this mean we should sin so God's grace becomes more apparent?\r\n\r\nCertainly not! When we died to sin, the flesh that controlled us was destroyed so that we would no longer be slaves to the appetites of the flesh. How could we continue to live in it? It goes against our very nature!\r\n\r\nWhen you were baptized, you died with Christ and just as Christ was raised again to live forever, so you will be raised into a new life with new behaviors. Our old (unrenewed) self was nailed to the cross so that it might no longer have sway over us. For when a man dies, he is freed from the power of sin. For Christ died to sin's power once and for all and now lives in unbroken fellowship with God!\r\n\r\nSo don't walk against the nature God has put in you to fulfill the lust of the flesh. Instead offer yourselves to God as though you have been raised to a perpetual life. For sin does not have dominion over you, since you are not under law, but under grace.\r\n\r\nWhat then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under God's favor and mercy?\r\n\r\nCertainty not! Don't you know that when you chose to believe in Christ you became slaves to him? Before you were slaves to Adam which resulted in your condemnation. What benefit did you reap then from the things you are now ashamed of? But now that you have becomes slaves to Christ, obedience and righteousness hold sway over your desires and actions! God now works in you what is pleasing to him! So just as you yielded yourself to the temptations of the flesh, now yield yourself to the temptations/promptings of the spirit as servants of righteousness. For when you were slaves to sin, righteousness did not have a pull on your heart. But now that you are set free from sin and have become slaves to God, your present reward is holiness and it's end is eternal life!\r\n\r\nFor sin results in condemnation, but the free gift of God is eternal life through union with Jesus Christ!\r\n\r\nDon't you know, that the law can only condemn you when you live? A married woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives, but if he dies she is free to marry another. But, if she remarries while her husband lives, she is called an adulteress. The law only binds her while her husband lives so that if she marries after he has passed away, she is not an adulteress.\r\n\r\nLikewise, you were once married to the law but you died so that now you are free to marry someone else. Now, you are married to Christ who was raised from the dead so that we might bear fruit to God!\r\n\r\nWhen we were living out of human effort, the sinful temptations aroused and awakened by the law were constantly operating in us, so that we bore fruit to our condemnation. But now we have been separated from the law which held us in sin by condemnation. Now we no longer serve not under the law, but under obedience to the promptings of the spirit.\r\n\r\nSo is the law identical with sin? No way! Nevertheless, if it had not been for the law, I would not have recognized sin. I would not have had any consciousness or sense of guilt over covertness if the law had not said, \"You shall not covet.\"\r\n\r\nBut sin is very clever. When I was condemned by the law, it found it's opportunity to arouse all kinds of sinful passions and desires in me. For apart from the law, sin is inactive.\r\n\r\nOnce I was doing well, free from condemnation, because I was unconscious of the law. But when I learned the commandment, sin was revived and I was condemned.\r\n\r\nThe very legal ordinance that was supposed to bring life, actually brought death! For sin, taking the opportunity afforded by the commandment cheated me and used the condemnation of the law to kill me. Therefore the law is holy and each commandment is holy just and good.\r\n\r\nDid the law, which is good, bring condemnation to me? Not at all. It was sin, working condemnation in me by using this good thing as a weapon in order that sin might be shown up clearly to be sin that I might perceive it.\r\n\r\nI know the law is good, but I am not. I am sold in slavery to sin! I do not understand myself, for I do not do what I wish, but I do the very thing I loathe! Not if I act habitually against my desire, that means I agree that the law is good. However, it is no longer I who is doing the deed, but sin that has possession of me. For nothing good dwells in me, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot perform it.\r\n\r\nNow if I do what I do not want to do then it is no longer me doing it, but the principle of sin which dwells within me. So I find this principle at work. When I want to do good, evil is ever present with me and I am subject to it's demands.\r\n\r\nMy new nature delights in God's law, but I also discern in my bodily members the desires of a different principle that wars against my mind making me a prisoner and slave to the law of sin that dwells in my flesh.\r\n\r\nO how miserable I am! Who will release and deliver me from this body of condemnation?\r\n\r\nThanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then my mind serves God, but my flesh is a slave to sin.\r\n\r\nTherefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus!!! For the principle of the Spirit of life (the principle of my new risen being) has freed me from the principle of sin and condemnation. For God did what the law could not do because my flesh could not carry it out. He condemned his son in the flesh as an offering. Now the demand of the law is fulfilled in us who have risen to a new life that is controlled by the spirit and not the flesh.\r\n\r\nFor those who are controlled by the flesh have their minds set on it's evil desires. They cannot please God! But those who are controlled by the Spirit have their minds set on the things that gratify Him!\r\n\r\nNow the mind controlled by self effort is constantly condemned and miserable, but the mind controlled by the Spirit brings life and peace! Your human effort, controlled by sin's temptations cannot fulfill God's law.\r\n\r\nBut you are not controlled by the flesh if you have the spirit in you! But if anyone does not possess the Holy Spirit he is not truly a child of God. But if Jesus lives in you, then although your natural body is dead by reason of sin and guilt, the spirit is alive because of the righteousness you have been given.\r\n\r\nAnd if the spirit who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, he will restore life to your mortal body as well!\r\n\r\nSo then, we are helplessly controlled by the Spirit, not to the flesh. So we might as well give in to the spirit's promptings. For those who are controlled by the sinful nature have been condemned, but if through the power of the Holy Spirit you have destroyed the flesh and it's hold over you, you shall really live forever.\r\n\r\nFor all who are led by the spirit of God are sons of God! The spirit that is in you is not a spirit of slavery to put you once more in fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption in the bliss of which we cry \"Papa!\" The Holy Spirit thus testifies with our spirit, assuring us that we are children of God. And if we are his children, then we are also heirs of God and fellow heirs of Christ, sharing his inheritance with Him! Only we are asked uphold this faith despite suffering so we might share in His glory.",

          "content:encoded": "<p dir=\"ltr\">This is my humble, loose paraphrase of Romans. I've been studying one of <a title=\"http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Romans_Theology_Paul.pdf\" href=\"http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Romans_Theology_Paul.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">N. T. Wright's articles</a> on Romans, which for an average reader like me was a difficult read. Nevertheless, some of his main concepts came through. I would like to summarize some of the things he said as well as my own observations to the best of my knowledge. I don't guarantee that I understood N. T. Wright completely so this is not a complete reflection on his material, but it is my best attempt. I hope if he read this he would be pleased.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Romans was likely written to proselytes, or gentiles who had converted over to Judaism and then later became Christians. In this time there was a lot of tension between Jews and Gentiles. The Jews were jealous of the Gentiles and didn't see them as equal people of God and the Gentiles were gloating over the Jews because God had accepted them while the Jews had failed in fulfilling their call. Paul's letter to Romans was concentrated on smoothing those tensions.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Paul's opening was a familiar opening to Jews of that day, how the gentiles were part of the problem of sin in the world and how unfaithful Jews were also accountable to that same problem.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This goes back to the overarching story of the Bible. When Adam disobeyed God, he messed up all of creation. Sin became a problem in the world. When Abraham came along, God planned for him to be the Father of the solution to fallen creation. Through Abraham, also Israel, God had planned to set the world to rights, to fix the problem of sin, and to restore creation back to the glory that Adam lost. Israel was given this call and the law was the means by which they would do that, at least as the average Jew thought.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the first couple chapters of Romans, Paul is explaining how just as the Gentiles were contributing to the problem of sin in creation, the Jews who were called to fix it, were also part of the problem themselves. They had failed in the calling God had given them. This is a problem for God's character. God's faithfulness is in question. If God said he would set the world to rights and Israel was his means by doing that and Israel failed at her task, then what does that say about God's faithfulness? Would God then be found a liar?</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is another one of the overarching arguments in Romans. As N. T. Wright says, when the Bible talks about God's righteousness it is not referring to his merits and good status that he then transfers onto the believer so the believer is counted as though he had done everything that God had, but rather God's righteousness has to do with his own covenant faithfulness. That is not to say that the believer is not given righteousness or made righteous, the believer is made righteous but it is not God's own righteousness which he has.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The word righteous to a jew was associated with a court room. When a case was tried, the judge would declare one person guilty and the other righteous. That is to say, one person broke the covenant, while the other faithfully upheld it. So in the Old Covenant, when we talk about God's righteousness, we are refering to how faithful he is to that covenant, which would have been to take care of his people, to be their God, to punish them when they did wrong but to be patient and tolerant. To show justice and mercy and hear their prayers. These were acts of God's covenant faithfulness. Now in Romans the faithfulness of God is in jeopardy. God planned to set the world to rights through Israel and the law but Israel failed. How then can God be faithful to his covenant?</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Romans 3:21 \"But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.\"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That is, the covenant faithfulness of God is now made known apart from the law. <span style=\"line-height:1.714285714;font-size:1rem;\">By trusting and relying on Jesus Christ we are freely given this righteousness. We have all sinned and now are justified, made upright, and in right standing with God completely and only because of his grace. </span>God sent his son, to show his justice. For he had not punished our sins knowing that he would one day punish them in Christ. Thus by punishing Christ, God has justly condemned sin while at the same time justified the sinner. He remains an honorable judge who can show unlimited mercy to us. Thus God's covenant faithfulness is preserved, because Jesus descends from Abraham and he is in fact the heir of the covenant. Israel's failure served to bring Christ all the more glory. Paul then says, so what makes a Jew better than a gentile anymore? Nothing! For man is now justified by faith alone apart from good deeds. Is God merely a God of the Jews or Gentiles also? It is God who justifies the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised by their newly acquired faith. (Circumcision was a distinguishing mark of the Jew). Then he says, \"Do we therefore make the law worthless by this faith? No! We are actually serving it's purpose!\" The law was the tool by which the world should have been set to rights, sin should have be dealt with, and creation restored to it's glory. But instead of fulfilling it's purpose, it in fact made sin a bigger problem. Now those who have faith in Christ become partakers in the divine call to restore the world. In Christ, sin has been dealt with and the world now looks forward to a future glory when one day all of creation, humans, beasts, birds, and the land itself will be free from it's bondage to decay.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Romans 4, the question then becomes, are the Gentiles then Abraham's heirs according to the flesh. Paul's answer was that he was made righteous before he was circumcised, not afterward. He was made righteous when he believed God. This shows that he is the father both of those who are circumcised and those who have faith in Christ. So then gentiles are Abraham's children, not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit, as a divine status and become heirs of the promise.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">God had made a promise to Abraham that he would be an heir of the world. What does this mean? I think it means that he would be part of God's plan to restore creation to it's glory. God had made man rulers of this earth and given them a task in the garden. God's plan is that we would once again rule a restored creation and be the people who set it again to rights, but not in the way we might think. We rule through being a servant. Blessed be the meek, blessed be the humble... This promise did not come through obeying the law, but instead came through faith. The law never brought us closer to fulfilling this calling rather it provided God's wrath. But where there is not law, there is no transgression.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Therefore, just as Abraham was made righteous through faith, we too are made righteous through faith. Christ was put to death to deal with our sin once and for all and raised again as a divine signature to show that he was in fact the heir of the promise and the one whom God had intended his covenant to be fulfilled in. For Christ was put to death because of our misdeeds and raised to secure our justification, absolving us from all guilt before God.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Therefore, since we are absolved of guilt, and God is no longer taking account of our sins, let us grasp that fact and enjoy the peace we have with God, since He has accepted us and put us on friendly terms with Him through Christ! Through him we have unlimited access by this faith into God's unmerited favor in which we firmly stand. And let us be excited in the hope of experiencing and enjoying the glory of God! That is the restoration of everything that Adam lost.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Moreover, let us be full of joy now! Even in our sufferings, knowing that persecution reveals our unwavering patience and that patience proves our faith is real. And this assurance of faith produces a joyful and confident hope! Such a hope never disappoints us because the Holy Spirit is in us, testifying that we are God's children through pouring God's love into our hearts! For while we were still powerless to overcome sin, at the fitting time, Christ died for all the ungodly. This is an extraordinary thing! For who gives up his life even for an upright man? Though if the man was noble, lovable and generous someone might even dare to die. When we were at our worst, God could have easily done away with us. But instead, he demonstrates His love towards us by sending his own son in our place! Therefore since we are now justified by Christ's blood, how much more certain is it that we shall be saved through him from God’s wrath? The wrath that will be displayed on the day of judgement when all men are judged for their deeds. If while we were enemies of God we were saved, how much more now that we are his children shall we be saved through his life!? Not only this so, but we also glory in God's love and perfection through Jesus Christ whom we have now received and enjoy reconciliation.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>",

          "content:encoded": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Sin was introduced to the world though one man, Adam, and death (condemnation) as a result of that sin. So death spread to all men and no one could escape it's power. Sin was in the world before the law was given, but it was not taken into account. Yet, even those who did not break a commandment of God were condemned. Adam was a pattern of Christ, he being destructive, but Christ saving! But God's free gift of righteousness is not even on the same scale as Adam's sin! For many died because of one man's offense but much more profusely does God's grace and free gift of undeserved favor that comes through one man Christ, abound and overflow for the benefit of many! Nor is Adam's condemnation to be compared with Christ's justification. For Adam was condemned for one single sin, but Christ justifies us despite many sins! For just as through Adam's sin, everyone was condemned, much more surely those who receive God's unmerited favor and free gift of righteousness shall reign as kings in life! The law came in only to increase our awareness of sin and stir up it’s movement, but where sin increased, God's grace has greatly surpassed it! Just as sin reigned in condemnation, so God's favor reigns through the gift of righteousness which results in eternal life through Jesus.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don't misunderstand me. You may think I am saying that we should live a crazy sinful lifestyle so God's grace becomes more apparent. I am certainly not! When we died to sin, the sin that controlled us was destroyed so that we would no longer be controlled by the appetites of the flesh. How could we continue to live in it? It goes against our very nature! When you were baptized, you died with Christ and just as Christ was raised again to live forever, so you will be raised into a new life with new behaviors. Our old (unrenewed) self was nailed to the cross so that it might no longer have sway over us. For when a man dies, he is freed from the influence and penalty of sin. For Christ died to sin's power once and for all and now lives in unbroken fellowship with God! So don't walk against the nature God has put in you to fulfill the lust of the flesh. Instead offer yourselves to God as though you have been raised to a perpetual life. For sin does not have dominion over you, since you are not under law, but under grace.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But what’s to stop us from sinning if we are free from the law and under grace instead?!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don't you know that when you chose to believe in Christ you became slaves to him? Before you were slaves to Adam which resulted in your condemnation. What benefit did you reap then from the things you are now ashamed of? But now that you have becomes slaves to Christ, righteousness motivates your desires and actions! God now works in you what is pleasing to him! So just as you yielded yourself to the temptations of the flesh, now yield yourself to the promptings of the Spirit as servants of righteousness. For when you were slaves to sin, righteousness did not have a pull on your heart. But now that you are set free from sin and have become slaves to God, your present reward is holiness and it's end is eternal life! For sin has given you nothing but condemnation, but the free gift of God is eternal life through union with Jesus Christ!</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don't you know, that the law can only condemn you when you live? A married woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives, but if he dies she is free to marry another. But, if she remarried while her husband lives, she is called an adulteress. The law only binds her while her husband lives so that if she marries after he has passed away, she is not an adulteress. Likewise, you were once married to the law but you died so that now you are free to marry Another. Now, you are married to Christ who was raised from the dead so that we might bear fruit to God! When we were living out of human effort, the sinful temptations aroused and awakened by the law were constantly operating in us, so that we bore fruit to our condemnation. But now we have been separated from the law which held us captive to those temptations through the power of condemnation. Now we no longer serve under the law, but under obedience to the promptings of the spirit.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So is the law identical with sin? No way! Nevertheless, if it had not been for the law, I would not have recognized sin. I would not have had any consciousness or sense of guilt over covertness if the law had not said, \"You shall not covet.\" But sin is very clever. When I was condemned by the law, it found it's opportunity to arouse all kinds of sinful passions and desires in me. The very legal ordinance that was supposed to bring life, actually brought death! For sin, taking the opportunity afforded by the commandment cheated me and used the condemnation of the law to kill me. Therefore the law is holy and each commandment is holy just and good. Did the law, which is good, bring death to me? Not at all. It was sin, working death in me by using this good thing as a weapon in order that sin might be shown up clearly to be sin that I might perceive it.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I know the law is good, but I am not. I am sold in slavery to sin! I do not understand myself, for I do not do what I wish, but I do the very thing I loathe! Now if I act habitually against my desire, that means I agree that the law is good. However, it is no longer I who is doing the deed, but sin that has possession of me. For nothing good dwells in me, in my flesh. I can will what is right, but I cannot perform it. Now if I do what I do not want to do then it is no longer me doing it, but the principle of sin which dwells within me. So I find this principle at work. When I want to do good, evil is ever present with me and I am subject to its’ demands. My new nature delights in God's law, but I also discern in my bodily members the desires of a different principle that wars against my mind making me a prisoner and slave to the principle of sin that dwells in my flesh. O how miserable I am! Who will release and deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then my mind serves God, but my flesh is a slave to sin.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus!!!</strong> For the principle of the Spirit of life (the principle of my new risen being) has freed me from the principle of sin and condemnation. For God did what the law could not do because flesh could not carry it out. He condemned his son in the flesh as an offering. Now the demand of the law that we be in right standing with God is fulfilled in us who have risen to a new life that is prompted by the spirit and not the flesh. For those who are controlled by the flesh have their minds set on it's evil desires. They cannot please God! But those who are controlled by the Spirit have their minds set on the things that gratify Him! Now the mind controlled by the flesh is constantly condemned and miserable, but the mind controlled by the Spirit brings life and peace! Your human effort, controlled by sin's temptations cannot fulfill God's law. But you are not controlled by the flesh if you have the spirit in you! But if anyone does not possess the Holy Spirit he is not truly a child of God. But if Jesus lives in you, then although your natural body is dead by reason of sin and guilt, the spirit is alive because of the righteousness you have been given. And if the spirit who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, he will restore life to your mortal body as well! So then, we are helplessly controlled by the Spirit, not the flesh. So we might as well give in to the Spirit's promptings. For those who are controlled by the sinful nature have been condemned, but if through the power of the Holy Spirit you have destroyed the flesh and it's hold over you, you shall really live forever.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God! The Spirit that is in you is not a spirit of slavery to put you once more in fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption in the bliss of which we cry \"Papa!\" The Holy Spirit thus testifies with our spirit, assuring us that we are children of God. And if we are his children, then we are also heirs of God and fellow heirs of Christ, sharing his inheritance with Him! Only we are asked to uphold this faith despite suffering so we might share in His glory.</p>",

          "content:encoded": "I have an amazing dad! When I was born, I had a terrible condition that would have killed me, but my dad paid a few million dollars for a treatment that worked. Ever since then, I feel the need to tell everybody. After that he wrote me a book of everything he wanted to say to me and for the next couple months and paid some of our bills for recovery. That's when I understood why he doesn't want to talk to me anymore because whenever I want to hear his voice I go and read the book he wrote me. It doesn't really bother me that he's not around anymore. No, he didn't die, but he just thinks our family will get along well enough without his help. I don't think he needs to be paying the bills for our home, my mother is already working three jobs to make ends meet. I once thought about asking him to help, but then I realized that would be selfish. I should really be focusing on telling everyone what he did. Yes, me and my dad have a great relationship and his book told me that when I was old enough to live on my own we would get to see each other again.\r\n\r\nThere is a theology that has gone around which says that God said everything he needed to in the Bible and did miracles to validate that ministry and then after it had caught on, backed off from the world and no longer gave interest.\r\n\r\nThat argument is not a scriptural one. From the beginning of Genesis to the end of Revelation God was speaking to his people. That argument against God's involvement in this world is based on one obscure passage.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 13:8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</blockquote>\r\nActually the argument is not rooted in scripture. It's very hard to twist this passage to say God no longer does these things today. Those who advocate that view said it was there to validate that message. My question is, did we stop preaching that message? Does this message no longer need to be validated?\r\n\r\nThe argument is not based on scripture but experience. Some people have not experienced hearing God's voice, healings, gifts, or miracles so they conclude God doesn't do them. And even that argument is sometimes worthless. For they do not consider many of miracles that happen on a daily basis all across America especially in California at Redding. No rather, when they hear of experiences like these they reject them or take offense at them.\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 13:53-58 \"When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?” they asked. “Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? Aren’t all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?” <strong>And they took offense at him</strong>.\r\n\r\nBut Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own town and in his own home.”\r\n\r\nAnd he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.</blockquote>\r\nI believe the problem here was they took offense at Jesus for who he claimed to be. This offense prevented them from experiencing the miracles Jesus wanted to do among them. If people take offense at the idea of God speaking today or doing miracles, I may not be surprised to find that their church does not see as many miracles. Why would Jesus give them something they would only take offense at?\r\n\r\nBut my purpose in writing this article was to rebuke that teaching and help people who've innocently grown up under it to see it for what it is. I hate being offense or rude, but sometimes it's important to offend people for their own benefit.",

          "content:encoded": "In religious systems there can be a lot of confusion about how God sees you. And I can understand why. We've not been taught how to distinguish the new covenant from the old. Because of that shift, God relates to us on different terms and some of the ways he related to people under the old covenant are no longer how he relates to us. Does that mean God is a different person? No, God stays the same yesterday, today, and forever. He was faithful to his covenant and a just judge. He judged Israel fairly. But God's justice is satisfied when Christ came and took the judgement you should have deserved. And because he has adequately punished sin, he remains a just God who can show unlimited mercy to his children. Because of what Christ did, you are no longer identified in Adam but in Jesus and you have become holy and blameless in his sight. Listen to how God describes the new covenant.\n\nBut in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises.\n<blockquote>Hebrews 8:7-13 \"For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another. But God found fault with the people and said :\n\n“The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord. This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest. <strong>For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more</strong>.” By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and outdated will soon disappear.\"\n\nHebrews 10:9-18 \"He sets aside the first to establish the second. <strong>And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all</strong>.\n\nDay after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when this priest had offered <strong>for all time one sacrifice</strong> for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool. <strong>For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.</strong>\n\nThe Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says: “This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds.” Then he adds: “<strong>Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.</strong>” And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary.\"</blockquote>\nDid you hear that? You have been made holy forever by Jesus's sacrifice. You are perfected and God remembers your sins no more.\n\nI remember times when I've talked to the Lord and said, \"Did you forgive me for that sin I committed?\"\n\nThe Lord would reply, \"What sin?\"\n\nDavid says the same thing and is quoted in Romans.\n<blockquote>Romans 4:4-8 \"Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness. David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:\n\n'Blessed are those whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the one whose sin the Lord will never count against them.'\"</blockquote>",

          "content:encoded": "My heart has been concerned and somewhat grieved to hear how some of us relate to God. I want to focus on people who've grown up in a passionate, \"sold out for God\" youth group where people have fallen absolutely in love with the Lord.\r\n\r\nI grew up in one of those youth groups. It changed my life and gave me an abiding love for the Lord that will never go away. It's so wonderful!\r\n\r\nBut even as I learned and realized so many wonderful things that transformed the way I saw God, the years to come showed me that I had to unlearn a few things as well.\r\n\r\nI love it when people show displays of their dedication, passion, and love for the Lord. They'll fast for weeks, pray on their faces for hours, stay up all night to call for more of God's presence and spirit and revival. It's their PDA. Public displays of affection.\r\n\r\nI'm sure the Lord appreciates it too. And those people do that from the heart as did I.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty however is this. In their passion, they miss how easy it is to relate to God and they make it complicated. They make it hard on themselves to be pleasing to God. For instance, they will pray on their faces all night for God's presence to come into their lives and church. Why is that sad? Isn't that awesome? Well yes it is awesome, but it's sad that they don't realize that they already have it. Or that God gives much more freely than that. And some people fell like if they don't keep that dedication up and maintain it, God looses interest in them. And when they realize that they can't live that way all the time, they fear that God will become distant from them. They've set up a standard by which God is pleased with them and wants to be friends and their faith is discouraged because they are not meeting that standard. A number of those people I have meet are very concerned and worried about not being as passionate about the Lord and showing it all the time. If they are not feeling as passionate about God they feel like God is no longer as interested in them. Am I making any sense?\r\n\r\nI wish their passion was not wasted on trying to attain something they have been freely given. I wish their passion was used to enjoy the kindness of the Lord and spread it to others.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nImagine that you had a friend who gave you a long speech filled with passion on how he wants to hear you speak or just to say a word to him. He wants to give you all he has and beg you to speak to him. Wouldn't you feel concerned? Wouldn't you just want to say, \"Why are you doing this? Don't you know I want to speak to you? You don't have to offer me any of those things, I want to speak, it's not that hard.\"\r\n\r\nI think God feels that same sense of compassion.\r\n\r\nThose people don't realize how close God already is, but they really want him to be. So they think, if I show such a display of affection that shows how \"sold out\" I am, won't then God notice my love for him and come close to me?\r\n\r\nTheir passion is good, but it's misguided.",

I'm quite a bit older than you and have been a Christian for many year's but yet do not feel close to God.  I believe much of it has to do with the way I view Him (legalistic).  I know we are supposed to put Him first, but I find it hard to do so as I feel condemned most of the time.  I also suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder which mainly manifests itself around everything I enjoy being sin.  For example, I've always been interested in fashion/style and have a large collection of magazines reflecting this interest (Vogue, In Style, and fashion catalogs from department stores).  I do try to be selective in that I don't read Cosmo or other such publications.  I guess you could say it is my hobby.  I realize there is not much one would call redeeming in these periodicals; however, they have not affected me negatively in the sense of wanting to be model skinny or dress in a provocative manner.  I just enjoy style and am often complimented on my sense of fashion.  The problem is that I feel guilty because it is hard for me to part with them.  I read or heard somewhere that anything one cannot part with is an idol.  Consequently, whenever I go through a trial, I feel it is God disciplining and/or punishing me for being unable to give up these things.  I have, on occasion, thrown them away, but then felt anger toward God and, consequently, went on to build more collections.  I just read and printed your post on God's discipline and can say it helped a lot.  Can you comment on what I've written?

          "content:encoded": "This is perhaps a question we are asking ourselves quite a bit. Especially in churches that talk a lot about the Holy Spirit, one thing that gets strongly emphasized is having a daily quiet time with God.\r\n\r\nAs much as I see it's value and importance, I know I have felt a lot of guilt and pressure from this question and I know many of my close friends have felt this way as well. Spending time with God changes our lives, it is the basis for Christian living. It is extremely important, and I want to encourage it with all my heart. So why do we find ourselves having a hard time finding enough time or motivating ourselves to spend time with God?\r\n\r\nThat's a question I'm asking myself at times. Sometimes, I get focused on something else I need to be doing and before I know it, it's been a few days and I haven't sat down and spent any dedicated time with Him. And when I finally do, I have to vent my frustration and guilt over not reaching Him sooner.\r\n\r\nBut the Lord always has an encouraging word.\r\n\r\n\"Are you still basing your relationship with me on how much time you spend with me?\"\r\n\r\nThis challenges the way I see spending time with God. I felt like God began comparing our relationship to the relationship of a close friend.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a close friend, do you have to talk everyday to maintain your friendship? Don't you have friends who you only talk to every few weeks or months and yet when you talk you pick up right where you left off? And when you spend time with your friends, do you always do the same things? Do you only talk? Or do you sometimes go watch a move together? Maybe you play music, go on a walk, work on a project, find something unique that you are both interested in, invest in a hobby or sport, perhaps, you play a bored or video game together.\r\n\r\nThe point is, when you spend time with your friend, you don't always do the same thing every time. (Of course, if you live far apart, talking may be the main option.) And there are seasons in which you and your close friend spend a whole lot of time together and there are times when both of you are busy with other things and you go a long time without speaking. Does this mean the friendship can't survive?\r\n\r\nIf you felt a pressure to call that friend every morning at a certain time even when you didn't want to or didn't have time, that relationship wouldn't last very long would it? You would begin to resent that friendship. (Unless of course you enjoyed talking every morning). There is a level of spontaneity that is acceptable and needed in every friendship, permission to have a break from each other and permission to plan things on the spur of the moment.\r\n\r\nI like what my friend John Long had to say about our daily quiet time. \"If you ask a typical christian how much time you should be spending with God, you will get the answer, 'A little bit more.'\"\r\n\r\nWith God, there will be seasons when you spend a whole lot of time together, focused learning and discovering more about Him, and there are seasons when you are both content with each other and coast along enjoying each other's company.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes we feel a pressure to always be growing deeper with God. Would that work with a spouse? If everyday you needed to find something new about your spouse to be content with your relationship would it work? Aren't there times when you and your spouse are content with one another and coast along enjoying each other's company. And maybe after a time of rest you pick up where you left off and begin to rediscover each other again? Relationships need time to grow and time to rest, both are important.\r\n\r\nAnd why must our time with God always look the same every time? When me and God spend time together I don't always just talk with Him. Sometimes I ask what he wants to do. He has suggested that I program a website and he will assist me. He has encouraged me to write blog articles or listen to a sermon. He may have me research something in the Bible or sometimes we just watch a movie together and he comments on it. Our time together doesn't always have to look the same but whatever we do, we do not do alone. If I program, he is there giving advice. If we watch a film, he is giving his thoughts on it. If we listen to a sermon, we will talk about it afterward.\r\n\r\nSpending time with God does not have to always look like shutting your door and spending focused time praying and talking. That can sometimes be needed, but if you realize that God wants to be involved in every part of your life, you will be able to spend time with Him wherever you go and whatever your situation is. If you are in the middle of taking a test, ask God for the answers. Hahahaha, is that cheating? I'm not sure, but the Lord has done that for me.\r\n\r\nMy second point is this, that we do not need to be treating spending time with God as a chore that needs to be done. It's a relationship and it should be something we want to do. And if you are finding that you don't enjoy it as much as you should or if you are finding that you don't have the time or motivation to spend time with God, you shouldn't try to fix it with your own strength using more effort. Get God involved immediately and ask him to help you enjoy your relationship more and find more time. Don't be ashamed. I know we would rather God not know we are not as interested in spending time with him, but God is the Doctor. And when you are sick you do not run away from the doctor, but towards him. Even enjoying God, and spending time with Him, is something that is carried out through the power of the spirit, and not just our own determination and effort.\r\n\r\nGod has never stopped showing me grace when I haven't spent much time with Him. He's always just as happy to hear from me and we pick up where we left off, best friends. He's not wanting you to relate to him on a performance scale, thinking that He likes you depending on how much time you've spent with Him. So treat God like a friend and let him be gracious to you. Do not worry about how much time you are or are not spending and instead enjoy the time you do share together and trust in his spirit to help you find more time with him.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

          "content:encoded": "Wow! N T Wright.\r\n\r\n“He's a master theologian. If you can understand his readings you can understand the best of them.”\r\n\r\nGod?\r\n\r\n“Yea?”\r\n\r\nDid he get it right?\r\n\r\n“He is catching the big picture.”\r\n\r\nGod, does the law inspire sin? Does it cause us to sin?\r\n\r\n“You heard him say the law binds you to Adam.”\r\n\r\nYes?\r\n\r\n“The law identifies you with your sinful nature, the old self, Adam. It convicts you of who you are apart from me.”\r\n\r\nSo does that cause us to sin?\r\n\r\n“Your actions come from your identify, or who you believe yourself to be. That's the basis of a habit. Habits, and I'm talking about sinful habits, are developed when a person identifies his nature after the sin he commits. Instead of seeing himself as sanctified, holy, and separate from those mistakes, he thinks that is all he is capable of.”\r\n\r\nSo, what is the correct way. What should I do after I sin?\r\n\r\n“Thank God you will not receive your just penalty. You need to turn you eyes back to God and your affections back to him, reminding yourself and strengthening yourself in his grace. Jon Paul, when you let go of grace, sin becomes attractive.”\r\n\r\nBut doesn't the spirit keep us from sin?\r\n\r\n“Yes, but don't forget he is called the spirit of grace. The law works in the opposite spirit, it convicts of sin. As such you cannot live successfully under both. What the law cannot do the spirit is well able.”\r\n\r\nDoes the spirit just produce everything the law says we should do anyways?\r\n\r\n“The way of the spirit is life and peace. You will find mercy in his steps. The law is primitive compared to the spirit. The law deals only with external show, it does not deal with the heart. The Spirit works in you what is pleasing in my sight, from the inside out, provided you continue in my grace.”\r\n\r\nBut don't people do amazing works through fear of punishment?\r\n\r\n“The motivation is not the same. I want to see my children giving gratefully and cheerfully. Giving in fear is not pleasurable to me, just as it wouldn't be to you. Would you want your friends to do nice things for you because they were afraid of you?”\r\n\r\nNo Lord, that would feel lonely.\r\n\r\n“And for a God who identifies himself as being love, that is blasphemy of my character. Fear may look good on the outside, but it is awful on the inside. Whenever you hear a ministry that preaches through fear, run. You cannot have confidence in God's word or love towards you if you operate under fear based preaching.”\r\n\r\nSo how... how do I not live under the law? It says not to murder, and I really can't get away from not murdering.\r\n\r\n“I think you are taking this too literally. The goal is not to prove that those commandments are bad. Practically what it means to no longer be under law is to no longer be under the condemnation of the law. When you do good, be satisfied. When you fail, don't look to the law for encouragement, it will give up on you. Instead listen to the Spirit of grace. He will tell you your true name and will guide you gently.”\r\n\r\nShould I still aspire to everything the law says?\r\n\r\n“If by that you mean should you not murder then I would say yes.”\r\n\r\nBut things like circumcision no? I mean, some of the commandments are outdated right?\r\n\r\n“No longer in effect? Yes, some of them in fact insult me.”\r\n\r\nO yea. So how do I know which ones I should aspire to?\r\n\r\n“Jon Paul, the law is no longer your guide. It cannot tell you all the fine print of what I love, that's why I wrote it on your heart. If you want to please me, you won't find a long list of do's and don'ts. You will find a heart that is grateful and wants to show it.”\r\n\r\nWow.\r\n\r\n“Paul did give long lists, and I do love all of those. But do you think he told you everything I love? My point is there is not a list long enough for you to memorize. You must trust the daily guidance of the Spirit.”\r\n\r\nThanks God!\r\n\r\n“Good night dear child. I love you, and I will put my love in your heart. But I want you to remain in my grace so that it can produce it's full effect in your life.”",

          "content:encoded": "I've been noticing that the grace movement has become a lot more popular than it was in these past two years. I'm seeing people creating blogs, studying scripture for themselves, and finding speakers being more bold to talk about God's grace.\n\nI wanted to share some advise to my young fellow grace preachers that I've learned from my own experience teaching grace these past 4 years. Again, I'm by no means an expert, and this advise is coming from my own mistakes, some of which you may notice in my articles.\n\nI think all of us have had our lives changed in powerful ways and we've found so much more joy and freedom in our relationships with God and each other. Most of us probably if not all of us have also found that instead of turning to a life of sin after hearing this message we found ourselves bearing good fruit with sincere hearts in joy. I believe this message is correct, because I see it in the scriptures, I hear it from the Lord personally, and I see it bearing good fruit in my life and in the lives of others.\n\nI say all this, because I want to give you confidence in what you teach so that you will not be discouraged when you come against opposition. Sometimes I've felt a great burden of proof or having to be convincing to others who didn't see things the same way I did. I have learned some things from these experiences that I want to share with you. Again, I'm by no means an expert, these are just some things on my heart.\n\nWhen people object to the grace movement, it's not always a legalistic mentality. People have been brought up their whole lives with the Bible being explained one way and they derive their beliefs from how they interpret the Bible. This means those of us who are passionate about teaching need to understand and respect their viewpoint and not judge them because they don't see things the way we do. I at first opposed the message of grace myself and thought it was blasphemous. We need to be gracious about teaching grace, something that was and somewhat still is hard for me now that I've become so passionate about it.\n\nMy second point is that teachers need to avoid alienating people due to misunderstanding. We may say something like, \"Since Christ obeyed the law perfectly, our obedience doesn't matter anymore!\" I think it is to be understood that we mean, \"Since Christ faithfully fulfilled the covenant, we are made righteous and therefore God is no longer assessing us based on our works!\" (Or something like that) Often times we use language that is not easily understood to an audience that is not familiar with the grace message and we end up offending them or alienating people who under different circumstances would appreciate the message.\n\nI can't tell you how many people I offended because I was using language that didn't make sense or didn't convey what I meant. And I have to reinterpret a lot of statements with some of the pastors I love to listen to. When you've heard their entire viewpoint, you can understand that they aren't intending to mean certain things when they say some phrases. However, someone who is hearing for the first time will likely face confusion or be turned off by the message. For instance, when we say we are no longer under the law, we also need to be careful to explain why this does not promote sin. Unfortunately, a lot of people who do use grace for immorality have used that same phrase to mean that any sin you want to do is now acceptable and good with God. We want to avoid coming across that way to listeners.\n\nMy final point is that teachers need to represent scripture accurately and according to the way it was intended to be conveyed as best they can. This is not specific to grace preachers, I have seen this in part from every denomination. It is especially true of myself. Sometimes when we become passionate about something, we like to reinterpret everything we read to mean what we are passionate about. If we want to be convincing however to people we speak to, then we need to be upholding scripture objectively and with integrity so people can trust the things we say. Have you ever been in a really good sermon in which everything was very powerful and true but at one point the pastor takes a Bible verse and completely misinterprets it to fit his viewpoint? It destroys the trust you have in what he's saying and it's hard not to question other things he says. You may ask yourself, if he's twisting this scripture to fit his viewpoint, is he twisting other scriptures to?\n\nThere are areas in the Bible that are just plain confusing for everyone and I don't think anyone understands those passages perfectly. But we want to be humble and be willing to challenge our ideas, to ask hard questions, and change our views if necessary. I believe the Bible at it's core does teach grace, and that's why I am not so afraid to do this. Whatever confusion I fall into, I will eventually, with the Lord's help, fall back into grace.\n\nEspecially if we are claiming to represent the true gospel, a gospel that has been understood and misunderstood in previous years, and we are claiming to be speaking what Paul truly intended, we put on ourselves a heavier responsibility to represent well what we teach. And honestly, I think those are too great of titles for anyone to bear. We are trying our best just like previous generations, but if we want to stand out, we should encourage ourselves to be objective, studious, and take time to see the argument from both sides.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't know why I have the audacity to say this stuff to my readers when I still do the same things myself (of course not intentionally). I guess I see the importance for myself and others and I'm training myself to think more carefully about how I see the Bible. That's why I like to study scholars like N. T. Wright, David Bivin, and others to see if there's any embarrassing misinterpretations I may be about to make in trying to uphold scripture.\n\nSo, please don't be discouraged by my advise, it's there to help your teaching be more effective. And you don't have to understand the scripture perfectly in order to teach, no one does and we all have things on our hearts we need to share. Perhaps, the lesson is to be more clear when we communicate, more respectful of others, and more humble in our instruction. Let's make it easy for people to see things from our point of view and pay attention to ourselves so we don't put stumbling blocks in other people's way.\n\nSo I ask for your grace myself, I know I still do this, though I don't intend to or want to. I hope to represent the scripture as best as I know how and I know my fellow grace preachers do as well.",

          "content:encoded": "<p>I grew up in a non-denominational/charismatic background and have recycled the same teachings and theology for about 19 years. In these past few years I was introduced to several other churches and denominations. And now upon returning to visit some of my old non-denominational churches I've found that I don't see some things the same way I used to.</p><p>There are some things that are wonderful about being in a non-denominational church. Rich, genuine, free worship from the heart. The tangible presence of God (more so celebrated and observed than in some other denominations), the gifts of the spirit, and spiritual passion, pursuit, and hunger for God, and belief that God is active in the world today and wants to bless us. On top of that, leaders typically don't like to get into routines and instead leave lots of room for the Holy Spirit's guidance, whether that means skipping the sermon to worship longer, or praying or speaking longer etc... Most people I meet there have genuine relationships with God and let their lives be guided by his spirit and words.</p><p>Speaking then as a fellow charismatic, I've noticed some of the popular beliefs that get circled through many types of non-denominal/charismatic churches that cause a great deal of confusion and pain in my life and has lead to a subtle form of spiritual chaos and odd behavior in these circles, that once to me was normal and now I actually find somewhat disturbing.</p><p>I have a lot of compassion for my home denomination as I am all too familiar of how the basic teachings affected my life and how the Lord has guided me out of some of them. If I had to summarize those views I would basically describe them as taking old covenant theology and spiritualizing it. Keep in mind, I don't mean any harm or offense to my companions, rather my heart has been yearning to see freedom hit these areas and I do so humbly.</p><p>It's easy to understand how this could be done actually. Some areas of the Bible can be tricky to discern and most of the people in these circles have not been taught to clearly distinguish between the new and the old covenant. So we take these old covenant principles and spiritualize them in a special kind of spiritual rule or experience in order to make them relevant. This can be said about tithing, generational curse, spiritual strongholds and bondage.</p><p>However the one I heard today and want to focus on is the legal right of the enemy to invade and bring harm to your life.</p><p>It is a pretty widespread belief that when you sin you are opening the door for the enemy to cause chaos in your life. Thus our sin gives the enemy spiritual permission to cause terrible events in our lives. Part of the inner-healing ministry involves breaking this right the enemy has by confessing sin and forgiving people who have sinned against us.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

          "content:encoded": "I have been visiting different churches in my area, looking for a church that teaches with a grace-perspective lens. Not necessarily one I completely agree with, just one that has a decent grasp on justification completely by faith and not being under the law or any curses. One of the messages I often hear is the 'do more' message. I'm not going to write my perspective on that message right now, but I am going to point out why I think we find that kind of preaching so widespread.\r\n\r\n<strong>It originates with how we interpret the words of Jesus. </strong>\r\n\r\nI am convinced the idea that law and grace are mixed originated from a misunderstanding of the gospels. The idea of conditional salvation also, I believe, originated there. And it is not surprising! I often wonder why Jesus said some of the things he did and how I should interpret them.\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 5:29 \"If your right eye causes you to <strong>stumble</strong>, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.\"</blockquote>\r\nNotice the simple logic in this passage. Those who stumble perish in hell. What example does he give of 'stumble?' Fall away from the faith? Not even that dramatic! For looking at a woman lustfully!\r\n\r\nPeople who teach the 'do more' message are not doing so out of their own invention or trying to go against the doctrine of justification by faith, rather they are just struggling to understand what Jesus meant.\r\n\r\nAnd this makes it frustrating for me as I'm studying, because at this point, I don't know enough or see enough to explain why Jesus said everything he did. I have a theory, but that theory needs more testing. I am praying that the Lord will give me understanding and am hoping to find some evidence to explain it's interpretation.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I stumbled upon this <a title=\"http://www.desiringgod.org/conference-messages/did-jesus-preach-the-gospel-of-evangelicalism\" href=\"http://www.desiringgod.org/conference-messages/did-jesus-preach-the-gospel-of-evangelicalism\" target=\"_blank\">sermon</a> by John Piper that... in 20 years of going to church have never heard the likes of. I have never heard such a powerful and grace-convicting sermon. It moved me to tears and helped explain something I had been struggling to understand for years, how not to put confidence in my flesh. You can stop reading this post now and just listen to it, you do not need to finish this post if you listen to it. I am condensing and emphasizing one point he made in my own way for those of you who don't have an hour to listen.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://www.desiringgod.org/conference-messages/did-jesus-preach-the-gospel-of-evangelicalism\" href=\"http://www.desiringgod.org/conference-messages/did-jesus-preach-the-gospel-of-evangelicalism\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.desiringgod.org/conference-messages/did-jesus-preach-the-gospel-of-evangelicalism</a>\r\n\r\nIn my mind, I knew before we were saved we shouldn't put confidence in our flesh because we had the sinful nature. But after we were saved, I wondered if we were supposed to have confidence in our flesh, because it was the Holy Spirit producing those works in us and we were given a new nature. The matter got complicated further when realizing that grace causes sin to loose dominion over us. So if I have a new nature that is supposed to live differently, God's own spirit living inside of my heart and motivating my heart and actions to serve him, and I'm under an amazing grace that makes me grateful and produces good fruit in my life. Well then... am I then supposed to trust my flesh?\r\n\r\nAccording to the words of Jesus. No. Not even when everything is going for me. Not when I am at the top of my game, grateful, guided by the Spirit, and fully alive.\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean by trusting in my flesh? I don't mean depending on it for salvation or being right with God. I wasn't doing that. I mean having confidence and trusting in my performance for relating to God and expecting that to be stable.\r\n\r\nThe message of grace is not perfectionism under disguise. What do I mean by that? Knowing grace doesn't make you perfect in behavior. I think that a gracious understanding and gratefulness will motivate the heart in a far greater measure than any amount of law, but even with this blessing, we should not make the mistake of putting trust in our flesh.\r\n<blockquote>Luke 18:9-14 \"<span class=\"text Luke-18-9\">Then Jesus told this story to some who had great confidence in their own righteousness and scorned everyone else:<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-25666\" class=\"text Luke-18-10\"><span class=\"woj\">“Two men went to the Temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a despised tax collector.<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-25667\" class=\"text Luke-18-11\"><span class=\"woj\">The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed this prayer: ‘I <strong>thank you, God</strong>, that I am not a sinner like everyone else. For I don’t cheat, I don’t sin, and I don’t commit adultery. I’m certainly not like that tax collector!</span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-25668\" class=\"text Luke-18-12\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup><span class=\"woj\">I fast twice a week, and I give you a tenth of my income.’</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"en-NLT-25669\" class=\"text Luke-18-13\"><span class=\"woj\">“But the tax collector stood at a distance and dared not even lift his eyes to heaven as he prayed. Instead, he beat his chest in sorrow, saying, ‘O God, be merciful to me, for I am a sinner.’<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-25670\" class=\"text Luke-18-14\"><span class=\"woj\">I tell you, this sinner, not the Pharisee, returned home justified before God. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”\"</span></span></blockquote>\r\nNotice that the Pharisee wasn't thinking that he generated his righteousness through his own strength. He was thanking God for God producing that righteousness in him.\r\n\r\nThis man had God-produced righteousness yet he was not justified. No, it was rather the humble man who went home justified.\r\n\r\nWhat does that tell us about God? That he loves trust in his grace more than he loves perfect works. He loves humility. I believe if God had a choice between creating a perfect man or creating a trusting man who sinned, he would choose a trusting man who sinned, because there God's love can abound.\r\n\r\nIf that is offensive I want to let it be offensive. It needs to be. You might say that the Pharisee did have sin in his life and just didn't realize it and that's why God didn't justify him, which is true. But supposedly he was much better off than the tax collector who was well known in Jesus's day to extort people for their money and lie.\r\n\r\nGod preferred the humble extorter to the non-sinning, tithing, passionate leader.\r\n<blockquote>Philippians 3:2-9 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-29384\" class=\"text Phil-3-2\">Watch out for those dogs, those people who do evil, those mutilators who say you must be circumcised to be saved.</span> <span id=\"en-NLT-29385\" class=\"text Phil-3-3\">For we who worship by the Spirit of God are the ones who are truly circumcised. <strong>We rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us. We put no confidence in human effort</strong>,</span> <span id=\"en-NLT-29386\" class=\"text Phil-3-4\">though I could have confidence in my own effort if anyone could. Indeed, if others have reason for confidence in their own efforts, I have even more!</span>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"en-NLT-29387\" class=\"text Phil-3-5\">I was circumcised when I was eight days old. I am a pure-blooded citizen of Israel and a member of the tribe of Benjamin—a real Hebrew if there ever was one! I was a member of the Pharisees, who demand the strictest obedience to the Jewish law.</span> <span id=\"en-NLT-29388\" class=\"text Phil-3-6\">I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church. And as for righteousness, I obeyed the law without fault.</span>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"en-NLT-29389\" class=\"text Phil-3-7\">I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done.<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-29390\" class=\"text Phil-3-8\">Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I could gain Christ<span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\"><span style=\"line-height:10px;\"> </span></span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-29391\" class=\"text Phil-3-9\">and become one with him. <strong>I no longer count on my own righteousness through obeying the law; rather, I become righteous through faith in Christ.</strong><span style=\"font-size:9px;line-height:22px;\"> </span>For God’s way of making us right with himself depends on faith.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nMaybe this understanding gives us some insight into why Jesus said and did some of the things he did. Maybe he was using the law to humble the prideful and to show them their sins. Let us not make the mistake of trusting in our flesh and \"counting\" on ourselves to have good behavior. Behavior is a fruit of the gospel, it is not the root. As soon as behavior gets mixed into the foundation of being alright with God, it becomes unstable, just like building the foundation half way on sand and half way on concrete.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://www.desiringgod.org/conference-messages/did-jesus-preach-the-gospel-of-evangelicalism\" href=\"http://www.desiringgod.org/conference-messages/did-jesus-preach-the-gospel-of-evangelicalism\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.desiringgod.org/conference-messages/did-jesus-preach-the-gospel-of-evangelicalism</a>",

          "content:encoded": "When Jesus gave himself for us, he wanted to give us confidence and security in our hearts that we were right and at peace with God.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 5:1 \"Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 9:9 \"This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were <strong>not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper</strong>.\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 9:14 \"The blood of Christ, who had no defect, does even more. Through the eternal Spirit he offered himself to God and <strong>cleansed our consciences</strong> from the useless things we had done. Now we can serve the living God.\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 4:16 \"Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need\"\r\n\r\nEphesians 3:12 \"Because of Christ and our faith in him, we can now come boldly and confidently into God's presence.\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 10:22 \"let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.\"</blockquote>\r\nToday there is a belief that a believer must confess each of his sins every time he commits them to remain forgiven and accepted by God. This belief varies in how it's practiced. Some say we can confess sins in chunks, however they only receive forgiveness for the chunk they confessed. Others say confession is not necessary for forgiveness but God won't want to be near you until you do confess. Even others suggest that unless you also turn from that behavior and fix yourself your confession means nothing and you are not right with God.\r\n\r\nSuch teachings steal from the confidence and assurance Jesus wanted to give us. I've heard of a few people who would pray that God would not let them die before they had confessed all their sins. They were worried if they died and had some unconfessed sin in their life, they weren't going to go to heaven. Others have taken confession to the point where they could not function properly in public. They would be in the middle of a sports game and would have to confess for having a bad thought. These people took confession seriously.\r\n\r\nConfession to one another can be useful if we use it properly. It can bring healing and restoration in relationships when we've wronged someone else and can be a tool to help us overcome our sins or guilt by admitting we need help. However, when we make God's acceptance, relationship with us, and forgiveness conditional upon our confession, then instead of bringing life it actually becomes a source of stress and worry.\r\n<h2>An intimate reminder of sin</h2>\r\nThe old testament sacrifices continually reminded us of sin. Every day, 'Hi Bob'. 'Hi Joe, lusted again? Weren't you just in here yesterday? And the day before that?' 'Yep, let's get this sacrifice over with.' Each day you were intimately reminded of how many times you had failed. These sacrifices were temporary, they only covered the sins committed up until that point.\r\n\r\nJesus's sacrifice was superior because it only needed to be offered once. How could it be offered only once? Because it also covered future sins. You see, if Jesus's blood was like animals, it would have to be reapplied every time a new sin was committed. But Jesus took away all sin once and for all.\r\n<blockquote>Colossians 3:13 \"When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. <strong>He forgave us all our sins</strong>,\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 10:10 \"For God's will was for us to be made holy by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ, <strong>once for all time</strong>.\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 7:27 \"Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins <strong>once for all</strong> when he offered himself.\"\r\n\r\n1 Peter 3:18 \"For Christ died for sins <strong>once for all</strong>, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit,\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 9:28 \"so also Christ was offered <strong>once for all time</strong> as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people.\"</blockquote>\r\nAnd since it cleanses forever and doesn't need to keep being redone, we can also have a clear conscience without the intimate reminder of sin every day. Confession acts as an intimate reminder of how often we fail and it causes us to believe for a moment we are unforgiven.\r\n<h2>1 John - If we confess our sins...</h2>\r\nHowever 1 John and James talk about confession and so we need to address these passages, one at a time. Daniel Mentz writes <a title=\"http://youaregodsbeloved3.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/1-john-19-are-you-a-believer-or-a-gnostic/\" href=\"http://youaregodsbeloved3.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/1-john-19-are-you-a-believer-or-a-gnostic/\" target=\"_blank\">a more thorough article on 1 John 1:9</a>. I will summarize the most important points.\r\n\r\n1 John was writing to two audiences: gnostics and christians. In the first chapter he primary deals with beliefs that gnostics held and encouraged them to join in true fellowship with other believers.\r\n<blockquote>1 John 1:3 \"We proclaim to you what we ourselves have actually seen and heard <strong>so that you may have fellowship with us</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nThen at the beginning of chapter 2 he begins to address the christians.\r\n<blockquote>1 John 2:1 \"My dear children, I am writing this to you so that you will not sin\"</blockquote>\r\n<a title=\"http://www.gotquestions.org/Christian-gnosticism.html\" href=\"http://www.gotquestions.org/Christian-gnosticism.html\" target=\"_blank\">Gnosticism</a> was a popular belief around the time of John's letter and held several theological errors that John specifically addresses in chapter 1. One of them being that sin did not matter or exist. The error in this theology is that if sin did not exist then forgiveness was not necessary and they could not be forgiven.\r\n<blockquote>1 John 1:8-9 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-30509\" class=\"text 1John-1-8\">If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth.<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-30510\" class=\"text 1John-1-9\">But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nThe first step to becoming a believer is realizing our need for a savior. When we admit that we are sinful and believe in what Jesus did for our sins, God is just and faithful to forgive us all our sins that we will ever commit from that moment on. If we don't admit that we have sins we won't reach out for God's forgiveness.\r\n<blockquote>\"cleanse us from <strong>all</strong> wickedness\"</blockquote>\r\nOnce you are cleansed from all wickedness, it is not necessary to continue to confess each individual sin, the point was the realization that we had sin at all.\r\n<h2>Continuous tense</h2>\r\nSome scholars argue that the word confess is in the present continuous tense showing that it is meant to be read \"continuously confess,\" or \"are confessing\" I am not a Greek scholar and I do not know enough to accurately prove this theory, but I would offer the suggestion that perhaps the reason for this is because it is written to a group of people as a whole. For each new person who comes to Christ he must realize that his sins need forgiveness. For instance,\r\n<blockquote>\"If American students <strong>keep on passing</strong> the ACT exam, we will have a superior education system!\"\r\n\r\n\"If we Americans <strong>are passing</strong> the ACT exam, we are facilitating a superior education system!\"</blockquote>\r\nEach person is assumed to pass the exam only once, yet because there are many people we can use the present continuous tense.\r\n<h2>2 John addresses Believers</h2>\r\nNow lets look at the first verse of the next chapter where he's addressing christians.\r\n<blockquote>1 John 2:1-2 \"My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.\"</blockquote>\r\nHe doesn't tell them to confess in order to be forgiven, he tells them, \"if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father.\"\r\n<h2>James</h2>\r\nNow let's look at the word of confession in James 5.\r\n<blockquote>James 5:13- 16 \"Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.<span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\"><span style=\"line-height:10px;\"> </span></span>And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.<span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\"><span style=\"line-height:10px;\"> </span></span>Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.</blockquote>\r\nI do not completely understand what he is saying but I can make some notes.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>James does not say unless you confess you cannot be forgiven. He says, \"If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.\"</li>\r\n\t<li>It seems he could be asking us to be vulnerable about where we are so that others can pray for God's healing and deliverance from that sickness or sin and reassure us of God's forgiveness. The sickness and sin do not necessarily need to be connected.</li>\r\n\t<li>Notice that shortly after James talks about helping people come to Christ furthering the case that he may be talking about helping each other turn from sin by admitting our struggles.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<blockquote>James 5:19-20 \"My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.\"</blockquote>\r\n<h2>But confession restores your relationship with God?</h2>\r\nConfessing your faults over and over does not bring you closer to God. God has drawn himself near by his own Hand.\r\n<blockquote>2 Corinthians 5:19 \"For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people's sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation\"</blockquote>\r\nYour relationship with God is built upon the steady foundation of Christ. Whatever is built upon him will be stable. But if you envision your relationship as built off of your flesh (your ability to confess, show good will, and improve your behavior) your confidence will shake. Even when you do well your confidence will shake, for you do not know when you will fail again. You will be like a wave of the sea, tossed and driven by your latest performance.\r\n<blockquote>Phillippians 3:3 \"For we who worship by the Spirit of God are the ones who are truly circumcised. We rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us. <strong>We put no confidence in human effort</strong>\"\r\n\r\nJeremiah 17:5 \"This is what the LORD says: \"Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the LORD.\"</blockquote>\r\nI'm not saying you will be cursed, merely that your flesh is unstable and not suitable to base God's relationship with you on.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 5:9 \"Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath <strong>through him</strong>!\"\r\n\r\nIsaiah 54:9 \"To me this is like the days of Noah, when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. So now I have sworn not to be angry with you, never to rebuke you again\"</blockquote>\r\nJesus's sacrifice adequately covered your sins, so God does not take offense at you and does not require a constant confession for you to maintain forgiveness. Also, if continuous confession is so important to be forgiven, why do none of Paul's letters address it?\r\n\r\nA great resource for this is, <a title=\"Jesus Gives Life Blogspot\" href=\"http://jesusgiveslife.blogspot.com/2007/08/1-john-19.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://jesusgiveslife.blogspot.com/2007/08/1-john-19.html</a>",

          "content:encoded": "A couple years ago I was studying the final day of judgement in Revelations and at one point was deeply saddened by the idea of people being tormented in hell forever. I talked to the Lord about it saying, \"Lord, at least let those people die and cease to exist instead of being tormented forever!\"\r\n\r\nThat evening I stumbled across a video which actually talked about this subject in a way I had never heard before.\r\n\r\nThe traditional ideas we have about hell have been somewhat foundational in our christian education and at least in my experience have rarely been questioned. In fact, I felt somehow it was wrong to question our traditional view. However, upon further study I realized how misinformed I was about this subject.\r\n\r\nThis is not a subject that is critical to our faith. We who believe in what Jesus did for us are not going to experience hell. However, many atheists are avoiding christianity because of our view of hell and what that says about God. Not to say that we should adopt our gospel because somebody doesn't like it, after all if it is true and the Lord has said it, we must hold to it. However, if you take the journey I went on, you may find that we don't have to hold onto the traditional model of hell and even that our present understanding holds little water.\r\n\r\nDozens of well-respected scholars including N T Wright have questioned today's ideas and have found that the Bible doesn't really teach hell that way. We often explain hell as a place of eternal torment where a person's spirit lives forever in pain. However, when a thorough examination of the Bible is made, you will find that the Bible much more so presents the picture of a temporary suffering and end. That is, those people who rejected the free gift of forgiveness through Jesus and lived their lives doing evil are sentenced to their torment and finally destroyed on the day of judgement. Not living forever, but completely dead, soul and body.\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 10:28 \"Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy <strong>both soul and body</strong> in hell.\"\r\n\r\nJohn 3:16 \"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall <strong>not perish, but have eternal life</strong>.\"\r\n\r\nEcclesiastes 9:10 \"Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might; for there is no activity or planning or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol...\" (Sheol and Hades are different translations of the same word. Sometimes hell is translated from the same word.)</blockquote>\r\nPeople who refuse to believe do not have eternal life in torment, they completely perish, soul and body.\r\n\r\nThis video which is an hour long, goes through the Bible, from the old testament to the new and explains some of the difficult scriptures and enforces this perspective.\r\n<blockquote><a title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHUPpmbTOV4\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHUPpmbTOV4\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHUPpmbTOV4</a></blockquote>\r\nThis video however does not cover well one particular parable about the rich man and lazarus. For that I have a scholarly article.\r\n<blockquote><a title=\"http://www.truthaccordingtoscripture.com/documents/death/the-rich-man-and-lazarus-dawson.php#.VKRFAYrF_xE\" href=\"http://www.truthaccordingtoscripture.com/documents/death/the-rich-man-and-lazarus-dawson.php#.VKRFAYrF_xE\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.truthaccordingtoscripture.com/documents/death/the-rich-man-and-lazarus-dawson.php#.VKRFAYrF_xE</a></blockquote>\r\nThis parable was actually a spin on a popular story that was told in that day. It originated with pagans possibly from Egypt or Greece and spread to Jews. The point of the parable was not to show us what happened in the after life, but to show us how God felt about the current condition of the unfaithful Jews.\r\n\r\nThe original story was told almost same way, however instead it was the rich man who was in Abraham's bosom and it was the poor man who was in hell. This was because the Jews saw riches as a sign of God's favor. You can see this in the story of Job and in the blessings given for keeping the law. It was perceived that those who were poor had sinned and offended God and the rich were favored. Jesus was using this story to point to the behavior of the unfaithful Jews who had been entrusted with the instructions of God and the favor of God, but had not shared that light with the Gentiles. As such those unfaithful Jews would be shut out of the kingdom while the Gentiles would be invited in because they believed while the unfaithful Jews killed their Messiah.\r\n\r\nJesus was not saying that their idea of hell was correct but instead he was revealing a faulty understanding of riches using their own story as a way to explain.\r\n<blockquote>It must also be remembered that this is only a parable, and not a real history; for, as Dr. Whitby affirms, \"we find this very parable in the Gemara Babylonicum.\" The story was not new, then, not original with Christ, but known among the Jews before He repeated it. He borrowed the parable from them, and employed it to show the judgment which awaited them. He represented the spiritual favors and privileges of the Jews by the wealth and luxury of the rich man, and the spiritual poverty of the Gentiles by the beggary and infirmity of Lazarus; and while the former would be deprived of their privileges and punished for their wickedness, the latter would enjoy the blessings of truth and faith. <em>The Jews accepted this picture of Abraham's bosom very much like many Christians accept the idea that the Apostle Peter supposedly sits at the Heavenly Pearly Gates, with the ledger of the faithful dead, and the keys of admission to bid them enter</em>. (Thomas B. Thayer, <em>The Origin &amp; History of the Doctrine of Endless Punishment</em> [Boston: Universalist Publishing House, 1855], p. 57.)</blockquote>\r\nI hope this evidence is thought provoking and encourages us to learn more.",

          "content:encoded": "In understanding the words of Jesus, a difficult concept to grasp is his use of the law. Why did Jesus use the law in his messages and what was his purpose? Was Jesus at odds with Paul?\r\n\r\nThese are legitimate questions and well studied scholars have strongly differing opinions on this subject. I am of the persuasion that Jesus was bringing out the law's convicting power in order to reveal our need for him and his grace. But then that leads to the question of why did Jesus not just start with grace? Why preach law at all? For that matter, why was the law ever given? Remember it was the same God who ushered in grace who also first gave the law initially through Moses.\r\n\r\nThese are some key verses the Bible gives to understanding why the law was given.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 3:19-20 <span id=\"en-NIV-28011\" class=\"text Rom-3-19\">Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, <strong>so that</strong> every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-28012\" class=\"text Rom-3-20\">Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.</span>\r\n\r\nGalatians 3:19-23 <span id=\"en-NIV-29122\" class=\"text Gal-3-19\">Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator.</span><span id=\"en-NIV-29123\" class=\"text Gal-3-20\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup>A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one.</span>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"en-NIV-29124\" class=\"text Gal-3-21\">Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-29125\" class=\"text Gal-3-22\"><strong>But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin</strong>, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe. (my own notes: <strong>meaning </strong><strong>not those who earned it</strong>)</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"text Gal-3-23\">Before the coming of this faith,<span style=\"font-size:10px;line-height:22px;\"> </span>we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-29127\" class=\"text Gal-3-24\">So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-29128\" class=\"text Gal-3-25\">Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.</span>\r\n\r\nRomans 10:2-4 <span id=\"en-NIV-28191\" class=\"text Rom-10-2\">For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge.</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-28192\" class=\"text Rom-10-3\">Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-28193\" class=\"text Rom-10-4\">Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.</span></blockquote>\r\nThe point of it being given through a mediator is to show that it was given from a distance, God alienated from the people. His holiness was unapproachable. The law locked everything under the control of sin. It acted like a mirror to expose our lack before God and the way He originally created us to be.\r\n\r\nWhy would this be needed?\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of time, God knowing all that would happen had already purposed his son to die for our sins and reconcile us to him. This was to demonstrate his great love for us.\r\n\r\nWithout the law we could not see how deprived we were of our original purpose and we would not realize our need for him. Just like a doctor cannot prescribe you medicine without first saying you have a condition, so God could not give the cure without first showing the need.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing our need for his salvation, we could never know how much He loved us and his great love would go to waste. Jesus would die, but for what?\r\n\r\nMy sins? What sins?! I'm doing pretty well.\r\n\r\nThis is the attitude the Israelites had when the law was given.\r\n<blockquote>Joshua 1:16 \"And they answered Joshua, 'All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.'\"</blockquote>\r\nWe see this purpose emphasized in a parable Jesus told.\r\n<blockquote>Luke 18:9-14 <span class=\"text Luke-18-9\">To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable:</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-25699\" class=\"text Luke-18-10\"><span class=\"woj\">“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span></span> <span id=\"en-NIV-25700\" class=\"text Luke-18-11\"><span class=\"woj\">The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.</span></span> <span id=\"en-NIV-25701\" class=\"text Luke-18-12\"><span class=\"woj\">I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"en-NIV-25702\" class=\"text Luke-18-13\"><span class=\"woj\">“But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’</span></span>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"en-NIV-25703\" class=\"text Luke-18-14\"><span class=\"woj\">“I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”</span></span></blockquote>\r\nWhy was God more pleased with the man who had more sin in his life yet knew his need for God's mercy than the one who obeyed the law better yet did not realize his need?\r\n\r\nBecause that's the whole point of the law and what God wants us to understand. We are not God. We are meant to be dependent on Him and his love and not trust in our own ability.\r\n\r\nSo in Jesus's ministry, it makes sense why he would use the law to prepare a hard people for grace. The Pharisees had misinterpreted the law by following the letter and not the heart of it. Because of this, the law had become doable and people could feel justified in their efforts. Jesus showed them that it must be obeyed fully both internally and externally, something that would have been impossible.\r\n\r\nYou may also realize that Paul had to do the same thing in his letter of Romans. The first few chapters are devoted to pointing out the sin of Jews and Gentiles alike and voiding their boast in the law. Even Paul realized that in order to understand and accept grace, we must all first realize our need for it.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 3:9 \"What shall we conclude then? Do we have any advantage? Not at all! For we have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin.\"\r\n\r\nJames 4:6 'Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”'</blockquote>\r\nPaul brought out the convicting power of the law in order to establish his point that grace is given freely and unearned. I once heard the Lord say this, and I feel it is appropriate in closing.\r\n<blockquote>\"The law demands what it cannot give, but grace gives what it cannot demand.\"</blockquote>",

          "content:encoded": "I have a heart for people who are struggling in their faith or bitter towards Christianity. I feel like I can relate to that situation as at one point in my life I was close to that. But that began an amazing journey of realizing how I had completely missed the point to Christianity and God's kindness paved the way home.\r\n\r\nIf you are tired of your faith or burnt out of Christianity, if you've realized that you can't lead the holy life you are meant to, if you are tired of seeing hypocrisy in Christians, then I want to speak to you. And I want to give the rest of the world a little insight into why you may feel like this.\r\n\r\nI actually sometimes find myself feeling proud of people who are walking away from the faith. Not because I'm happy they've left Christianity, but because I realize something special about them. They get it. Sometimes people who are burnt out have a clearer perspective of the gospel than most Christians.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be bitter towards Christianity to realize this profound yet simple truth. Some of the most passionate and authentic Christians at one point in their life almost left Christianity or held their ground against it for a long time or no longer go to church.\r\n\r\nWhat is this truth?\r\n\r\nThat we realize we can't do it. We can't live up to God's expectations and holy life. And people who think that they can are just pretending or have fooled themselves into thinking they're more capable than they are.\r\n\r\nWe all have our stories, trusted pastor committing an affair, serious Christians betraying their own laws, people masquerading around as if they uphold the holy and just standard of God.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the lines we realized, it's a facade. Behind the scenes if we are honest with ourselves we realize no one can do it.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 3:10 \"as it is written: 'None is righteous, no, not one;'\"</blockquote>\r\nAnd the sad story is that usually is where the story ends. When you realize you cannot earn righteousness you only have one option. To give up.\r\n\r\nAnd if you give up there are only two ways you can do it. Pretend God doesn't exist and it doesn't matter at all or discover an unearned, unlimited supply of God's grace.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately today we don't often teach that message of an unearned, unlimited supply of God's grace. Maybe we think that we do. We remind ourselves of how God gave Jesus to die for our sins so we could be forgiven. And in the same breath we may say something to the extent of now we can maintain what he's given us through our efforts. Now it's our turn to keep God's law since he's changed our hearts and made us able to.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry to say this but if that's the message you preach, you don't really teach grace. Grace isn't about empowering you to keep the law, it's about keeping you dependent on a God who will not stop showing you kindness even when you find yourself committing the same sins over and over.\r\n\r\nI am convinced no one at their core believes God doesn't exist. We know He does by nature. But we may fool ourselves because we don't want to deal with the picture of God we've received from others or even ourselves. It's our way of giving up. It's amazing how once someone's told you how to read the Bible it's hard not to understand it that way even though you try to see it differently. If we've been taught to interpret the Bible as a legalistic law based system we will always get that impression when we read it. We think we are learning on our own when really we are just repeating what we've already learned.\r\n\r\nSo what's this grace message all about? It belongs to people who are honest with themselves and realize that they cannot lead a holy life. It's about how Jesus knew that too and lead the perfect life for you and then swapped his perfect life for your messed up one.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 8:6-13 \"<span id=\"en-NIV-30099\" class=\"text Heb-8-6\">But in fact the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, since the new covenant is established on better promises. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30100\" class=\"text Heb-8-7\">For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30101\" class=\"text Heb-8-8\">But God found fault with the people and said <span class=\"text Heb-8-8\">“The days are coming, declares the Lord,</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-8-8\">when I will make a new covenant</span></span>\r\n<span class=\"text Heb-8-8\">with the people of Israel</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-8-8\">and with the people of Judah.</span></span>\r\n<span id=\"en-NIV-30102\" class=\"text Heb-8-9\">It will not be like the covenant</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-8-9\">I made with their ancestors</span></span>\r\n<span class=\"text Heb-8-9\">when I took them by the hand</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-8-9\">to lead them out of Egypt,</span></span>\r\n<span class=\"text Heb-8-9\">because they did not remain faithful to my covenant,</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-8-9\">and I turned away from them,</span></span>\r\n<span class=\"right\"><span class=\"text Heb-8-9\">declares the Lord.</span></span>\r\n<span id=\"en-NIV-30103\" class=\"text Heb-8-10\">This is the covenant I will establish with the people of Israel</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-8-10\">after that time, declares the Lord.</span></span>\r\n<span class=\"text Heb-8-10\">I will put my laws in their minds</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-8-10\">and write them on their hearts.</span></span>\r\n<span class=\"text Heb-8-10\">I will be their God,</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-8-10\">and they will be my people.</span></span>\r\n<span id=\"en-NIV-30104\" class=\"text Heb-8-11\">No longer will they teach their neighbor,</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-8-11\">or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’</span></span>\r\n<span class=\"text Heb-8-11\">because they will all know me,</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-8-11\">from the least of them to the greatest.</span></span>\r\n<strong><span id=\"en-NIV-30105\" class=\"text Heb-8-12\">For I will forgive their wickedness</span></strong>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><strong><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span></strong><span class=\"text Heb-8-12\"><strong>and will remember their sins no more</strong>.”</span></span></span></blockquote>\r\nThe first covenant, the covenant of the law is still sometimes being preached today. That's the covenant that tells us to try harder, to be more passionate, to love God more. The new covenant is a covenant of grace, a covenant of God does not remember your sins anymore. The result of this covenant is a heart of gratitude that overflows with good works, not in order to earn righteousness or make yourself right with God, but because it's in your heart to do. Stop and ask yourself this question. Do you really believe God doesn't remember your sins anymore?\r\n\r\nIf you are tired of running away from Christianity, if you are tired of trying to prove God doesn't exist, I want to give you another option. The Truth. And it's one you can live with. It's the truth of a gracious God who will forgive all your wrongdoings and remember your sins no more. It's a God who doesn't give up on you no matter how far you've strayed. It's a God who will leave the 99 sheep to find the one missing one. A God who wants you to lean on him and who calls you righteous and holy even while your act is not together.",

This article will delve deeper into the evidence for my translation of the above passage. As a quick summary however I will render this passage in a language I can understand and then explain how I got to that translation.\r\n<blockquote>Jon Paul's version: It is impossible for those who have heard and been invited into God’s promised rest, if they ignore His gift to be brought back to repentance from their useless rituals so long as they suppose the Jesus’s death was ineffective or must be offered over and over like their other animal sacrifices both subjecting him to shame and doing themselves detriment. Works that come from love spurred by faith are useful to God and obtain a blessing. But, the useless deeds and rituals of the old covenant are worthless to God. In the end they will be burned.</blockquote>\r\nExplaining this passage requires us to understand the heart of the book of Hebrews since it is a main point the author is making. So what was the point of Hebrews?\r\n\r\nImagine you had grown up your whole life as a jew under the law, obeying every rule and being careful to follow God's word. And imagine that when you had done wrong you were required to offer a sacrifice and cleansing in order to be right with God or God would punish you for your sins. Every time you offered those sacrifices they would intimately remind you of how often you had failed God. Even though it would provide temporary forgiveness, it would do so always reminding you of sin and leave your conscience full of guilt. Your whole life you had been required to perform these deeds and suddenly a man named Jesus had come in and offered a once and for all sacrifice for sins that was supposed to forgive all your sins for all time and void the need for offering sacrifices. Now let's suppose you began to believe in this Jesus but your friends and family didn't. They rejected you, threw you in prison, or persecuted you for your faith. They said things like, \"If you don't offer your sacrifice God will not forgive you. Do you want to withstand God's punishment?\"\r\n\r\nThis was the situation some of these Hebrews found themselves in. They were not sure that they could trust in what this one man Jesus had done and figured they needed to continue to perform the law and do rituals to make themselves right with God.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the letter of Hebrews is to declare the supremacy of Christ and his once and for all sacrifice, the need to no longer perform those rituals, and to encourage these jews to continue strong in their faith.\r\n\r\nThe author does this by taking them back to a time in their history when they faced a similar situation.\r\n<h2>Entering God's rest</h2>\r\nRemember the story of Moses and how he lead the Israelites out of Egypt? It has many similarities to our faith in Christ. The land of Egypt may represent how we were held in bondage under the control of sin. Passing through the red sea represents how we were baptized into Christ's death. And entering the promise land represents how we are to enter God's rest. The author of Hebrews uses this story to illustrate what our new covenant is like.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 3:16-19 <span id=\"en-NIV-30012\" class=\"text Heb-3-16\">Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30013\" class=\"text Heb-3-17\">And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness? </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30014\" class=\"text Heb-3-18\">And to whom did God swear that they would never <strong>enter his rest</strong> if not to those who disobeyed? </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30015\" class=\"text Heb-3-19\">So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.</span></blockquote>\r\nDo you recall the story? The Israelites were promised a wonderful land that God would give them. A land full of blessings they did not earn (Deuteronomy 6:10-11). But when it came time to actually enter the land, the Israelites saw the giants and didn't believe God could overcome them and so instead of entering the promise land they doubted and never entered God's promise.\r\n\r\nLikewise the jews in the time of Jesus were seeing the persecution that awaited them for their faith and they were afraid of entering into God's rest. They were seeing their giants.\r\n\r\nSo what does the promise land represent to us?\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 4:8-11 <span id=\"en-NIV-30023\" class=\"text Heb-4-8\">For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30024\" class=\"text Heb-4-9\">There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30025\" class=\"text Heb-4-10\"><strong>for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works</strong>, just as God did from his. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30026\" class=\"text Heb-4-11\">Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.</span></blockquote>\r\nThe promise land represents the rest of God. What do we mean by rest? Look at the verse again, \"for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works.\" What kind of works is he talking about? Are we saying we are supposed to follow the sabbath and don't do any manual labor on Saturday?\r\n\r\nNot at all, this is not the literal Sabbath but rather what the Sabbath stood for and we aren't resting from our manual labor in our career once a week but rather from our efforts to make ourselves right with God through the law.\r\n<h2>Dead Works</h2>\r\nThroughout Hebrews you will come across the phrase \"dead works\" or \"works that lead to death.\" Some translations such as the NIV include the footnote \"or from useless rituals.\" Upon first hearing the word you might assume it's a fancy word for immoral sins such as lust or greed or murder. However the context of the book of Hebrews shows that it represents something less familiar to us. The old covenant rituals required by the law.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10:11-14 <span id=\"en-NIV-30145\" class=\"text Heb-10-11\">Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30146\" class=\"text Heb-10-12\">But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30147\" class=\"text Heb-10-13\">and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30148\" class=\"text Heb-10-14\">For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.</span>\r\n\r\nHebrews 6:1 “Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go <strong>on unto perfection</strong>; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God”</blockquote>\r\nHere it means we are to take our faith out of our dead works and instead put faith in God or more specifically in Jesus's death. We know this is what he means because he continues throughout Hebrews to talk about perfection coming through Jesus's sacrifice and not the law.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10:1-2 “The law is only a <strong>shadow of the good things</strong> that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, <strong>make perfect</strong> those who draw near to worship. Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.\r\n\r\nHebrews 9:8-9,14 The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing. This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that <strong>the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper</strong>… How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, <strong>cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God</strong>!</blockquote>\r\nNotice the antecedent: the gifts and sacrifices are not able to cleanse our consciences of debt to God and so they had to keep being offered. But Christ's blood does such a good job of making us right with God that it even clears our consciences of the need to continue performing these rituals.\r\n<h2>Why do we need to repent of dead works?</h2>\r\nImagine you went on a business trip and brought a picture of your wife with you to remember her by. And before you went to bed you would kiss the photograph. Now let's say you arrived home and your wife was with you. But instead of kissing her you continued to kiss the photograph. That would be insulting wouldn't it? It used to have life in it but now it is dead because the actual person is there.\r\n\r\nIn the same way God has sent his beloved son to suffer and die for your sins. God had to endure his son being brutally mistreated so that by the kindness of his will you could be accepted. Now you turn around and say, \"I can do a better job. I can pay for my sins by offering this sacrifice or ritual or by trying harder. Your son didn't suffer enough for my sins.\" It's calling what he did useless and ineffective. It's insulting the Spirit of Grace (Hebrews 10:29).\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 5:4 “Christ is become of no effect to you, whoever of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace.”\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+3%3A3-9&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+3%3A3-9&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Philippians 3:3-9</a></blockquote>\r\nThat is the danger of dead works. Not only are they completely useless to you and God, but they actually insult Him. God has no intention of rewarding those works but in the end they will be burned and wasted away (Hebrews 6:8). This is the warning of our passage in Hebrews 6. However, the author assures us that God will not forget our labor of love of the things which are useful to God.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 6:10 \"God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.\"</blockquote>\r\nShowing people kindness and generosity and helping people in need or things which you are not doing to make yourself right with God but you are doing out of the gratefulness of God's love are things which are useful to God and receive a reward.\r\n<h2>Impossible to repent</h2>\r\nSo why would the author say it's impossible to bring us to repentance of those dead works?\r\n<blockquote>It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened... if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.</blockquote>\r\nThis has more to do with a translation error. A more correct translation in the greek would render the phrase \"as long as,\" something we find in the International Standard Version.\r\n<blockquote>and who have fallen away,<strong> as long as they continue to</strong> crucify the Son of God to their own detriment by exposing him to public ridicule (International Standard Version).</blockquote>\r\nOther translations render it as\r\n<blockquote>it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; <strong>seeing they crucify</strong> to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</blockquote>\r\nSeveral greek scholars have noted that the first statement is dependent on the second continuing to occur.\r\n<blockquote>\"and—a point of extreme importance which is constantly overlooked—<strong><span class=\"ital\">so long as it lasts</span></strong> a vital renewal is <span class=\"ital\">impossible\" (The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges)</span>.\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\" align=\"center\"><strong>Robert Dean Luginbill, Ph.D.</strong> - The phrase that follows in <a class=\"lbsBibleRef\" href=\"http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Hebrews%206.6\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 6:6</a>, \"crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace\" (NIV), has to mean something. Furthermore, in the Greek it is actually part of the same sentence as \"who have fallen away, to be brought back to repentance\" (NIV) – which means the two ideas are inseparably related in the actual Word of God. For that reason, to consider the first part in isolation from the first part is impossible – at least for anyone doing anything like honest exegesis. Since the two parts are interconnected, it must be the case that it is precisely because these individuals are \"crucifying Christ afresh\" that they cannot be restored. <strong>So what does \"crucifying Christ afresh\" mean?</strong> <strong>It means to continue sacrificing under the Mosaic Law and saying by one's actions in so doing that Christ has not yet come or that His work on the cross was not effective...</strong></p>\r\nIn that context, taking the participle \"crucifying\" as temporal not only makes good sense but the best sense and the only good sense. Whether one defines the relationship as temporal or causal or conditional, however, the relative time of the participle is established by the basic rules of Greek grammar: it is a present participle, so that it must be taking place at the same time as the main verb (perfect participles have antecedent action as do aorist participles, generally speaking; present participles never do). For this reason, the essential meaning of the first half of the verse is beyond dispute. <strong>It means that the action contained in the participle \"crucifying\" is the problem which prevents restoration</strong>. (<a title=\"http://ichthys.com/mail-Hebrews-6-and-10.htm\" href=\"http://ichthys.com/mail-Hebrews-6-and-10.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://ichthys.com/mail-Hebrews-6-and-10.htm</a>)</blockquote>\r\nSo then what is the author of Hebrews saying? That as long as they don't understand the effectiveness of Jesus' sacrifice, they will not repent of those dead works. Unless they are convinced that Jesus has fully forgiven them, that his sacrifice was once and for all and legitimate, they will not give up on their rituals. Their conscience cannot be cleansed from those dead works. This is why the author of Hebrews then continues to teach on the supremacy of Christ's sacrifice. He believes that when these jews realize how superior Christ is to their sacrifices that they will repent of them and serve God in a way that is useful.\r\n\r\nHebrews 10 drills this point home.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10:18 “And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary.\"</blockquote>",

          "content:encoded": "<blockquote>Titus 3:5-7 \"he saved us not by works of righteousness that we have done but on the basis of his mercy, through the washing of the new birth and the renewing of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us in full measure through Jesus Christ our Savior. 7 And so, since we have been justified by his grace, we become heirs with the confident expectation of eternal life.”</blockquote>\r\nThere is a strong debate between church denominations and scholars about eternal security. That is, how does salvation work? Is it once and for all, progressive, can it be lost? If you study the bible on this topic you may be confused about the large variety of differing scriptures on the subject. Scriptures that are clear and confirm that a believer can never loose their salvation and scriptures that suggest that somehow you must maintain it or else it will fail. I hope to explore some of the challenging verses on eternal security to properly understand them.\r\n<h2>Being Born Again</h2>\r\nIt helps if we understand something about the nature of salvation. Often it is compared to being \"born again.\" Now a birth is not a continuos action, it is a special moment with irreversible consequences. The result is you live and exist and have a life of meaning because of that birth. It would be foolish to think you could somehow undo that birth, or at some point decide you didn't want to be born and reverse it.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, our salvation is irreversible but it has lasting consequences in that you will live a life of meaning by the holy spirit as a result of that birth. And you will not die from that birth, because that birth is an eternal birth, and not a temporary physical one.\r\n\r\nLet's take the example of becoming \"God's son.\" Now, I may refute my father and deny him, but can that change the fact that he indeed is my father? Nothing I will can undermine the permanent reality of being his son. Salvation is not a test, and if at the end of our lives we do well enough we pass. It is a gift, but it is a gift that can be seen, proven, and will produce evidence that it indeed is genuine.\r\n<h2>Perseverance of the Saints</h2>\r\nHowever some scriptures seem to suggest that if you fail to maintain your faith, your salvation is lost (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A22-23&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A22-23&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Colossians 1:22-23</a>) (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A2&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A2&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">1 Corinthians 15:2</a>) (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A13&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+24%3A13&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew 24:13</a>). Recently I have found a missing piece of the puzzle that seems to interlink these opposing scriptures.\r\n\r\nYou see, those of us who believe we are saved once and for all may have missed another factor about salvation. And that is that if you are genuinely saved, God maintains your faith so that you are guaranteed to endure to the end. I think it is popularly called, the doctrine of the \"<a title=\"http://www.gospeloutreach.net/perseverance_of_the_saints.html\" href=\"http://www.gospeloutreach.net/perseverance_of_the_saints.html\" target=\"_blank\">perseverance of the saints</a>.\"\r\n\r\nPaul counts on the fact that God maintains the true believer's faith and he uses it as a way to identify if a believer is truly saved or not. An unbeliever who merely professed christianity but does not have genuine faith does not have the endurance the holy spirit produces and his departure is a sign he never was truly saved to begin with, not that he lost it (1 John 2:19).\r\n<blockquote>Jude 1:24 \"Now all glory to God, who is able to keep you from falling away and will bring you with great joy into his glorious presence without a single fault.\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 1:7-8 \"as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 8 who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+32%3A40&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah+32%3A40&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremiah 32:40</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+1%3A6&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+1%3A6&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Philippians 1:6</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A5&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A5&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">1 Peter 1:5</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12%3A2&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+12%3A2&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 12:2</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13%3A20-21&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13%3A20-21&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 13:20-21</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A23-24&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A23-24&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">1 Thessalonians 5:23-24</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A4-5&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+5%3A4-5&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">1 John 5:4-5</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+1%3A12&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+1%3A12&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">2 Timothy 1:12</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+3%3A3&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Thessalonians+3%3A3&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+5%3A10&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+5%3A10&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">1 Peter 5:10</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A39-40&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A39-40&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">John 6:39-40</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10%3A28&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10%3A28&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">John 10:28</a></blockquote>\r\nThe picture behind these verses, is that God's Spirit, who dwells in you works within to maintain your faith so that you stay firm to the end.\r\n<h2>But what if a believer walks away?</h2>\r\nI'm sure we've heard of stories about believers walking away from the faith, though I have not met that many. Were they never saved to begin with?\r\n\r\nIf they are walking away from the faith it can be a strong sign they were never saved to begin with.\r\n<blockquote>1 John 2:19 \"They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.\"</blockquote>\r\nHowever, you might also notice that some people who walk away later come back. This I believe it due to the Holy Spirit's work in them. If a person genuinely has the Spirit living in them, the Spirit will eventually turn their hearts back to him even if for a time they stumble.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 5:2 \"He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness.\" (Referring to Israel's high priests of which Jesus has become akin to.)\r\n\r\nJude 1:22 \"Be merciful to those who doubt.\"\r\n\r\n2 Timothy 2:13 \"if we are faithless, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself.\"</blockquote>\r\nWe do not need to be quick to judge someone else's faith, it is to God they must give account (Romans 8:33). We also know that God's looks at the heart, not just outward appearances (1 Samuel 16:7). Sometimes we might look at an event such as Peter denying Jesus three times and say, \"That person was never saved to begin with.\" Yet God understands the heart and he understood Peter was doing that out of fear not because he was rejecting Jesus. His faith was real even though his works didn't prove it at that moment.\r\n\r\nIf a person who is genuinely saved pretends for a while not to be, they are deceiving themselves, because deep down they still know it's true, even if they don't want to admit it. It would be like convincing yourself that you were never born.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 11:29 \"For God's gifts and his call can never be withdrawn.\"</blockquote>\r\nPeople who are not truly saved do not have that kind of genuine, inward, undeniable faith. If they do pretend to believe, it is merely shallow and temporary.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that most of the cases where I see people walking away from the faith is due to religion and law based preaching which is actually no gospel at all. The church teaches that if they cannot fully obey the law they can't go to heaven and these young christians realize they can't and give up. There is no grace to keep them holding to the faith. We may say they have walked away from the faith when really they are closer to it (because they have realized that they need grace).\r\n<h2>So how do you explain those non-eternal security passages?</h2>\r\nAnother theme we find in the Bible concerning eternal security is about people standing firm to the end.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 15:2 \"and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—<strong>unless you believed in vain</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nPaul assumes that these people will have enduring faith, but enduring faith is an indicator that that faith is genuine. It's another way of saying, \"if you are truly saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless you believed in vain,\" is actually part of a larger point Paul is making. Tassos Kioulachoglou gives a <a title=\"http://www.jba.gr/believing-in-vain.htm\" href=\"http://www.jba.gr/believing-in-vain.htm\" target=\"_blank\">great article on this verse illustrating from other verses in Corinthians that Paul was speaking in a hypothetical sense when he said, \"unless you believed in vain.\"</a>\r\n\r\nWe can see this from the following passage.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 15 \"12 But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13 If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. 14 And if Christ has not been raised, our <strong>preaching is useless</strong> and <strong>so is your faith</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nDo you see the parallels?\r\n<blockquote>\"if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, <strong>you have believed in vain</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhat makes their faith useless? In the hypothetical sense that Christ was not raised from the dead. And that was what some of them were believing. So its not unusual that Paul would mock them saying, unless you've believed in vain! He is alluding to his argument that if Christ has not been risen, then none of this is worth anything.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 15 \"17 And if Christ has not been raised, <strong>your faith is futile</strong>; you are still in your sins.\"</blockquote>\r\nOther translations emphasize this.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 15:2 \"It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you--unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place\" (New Living Translation).\r\n\r\n\"and by which you are also being saved if you hold firmly to the message I proclaimed to you—unless, of course, your faith was worthless\" (International Standard Version).\r\n\r\n\"through which also you are obtaining salvation, if you bear in mind the words in which I proclaimed it--unless indeed your faith has been unreal from the very first\" (Weymouth New Testament).</blockquote>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size:1.285714286rem;line-height:1.6;\">What about shipwrecked faith?</span></h2>\r\nSome people would suggest that since Alexander and Hymenaeus shipwrecked their faith it proves that true christians can fall away. However, there is a legitimate argument that these were not true christians, though perhaps professing christians.\r\n<blockquote>1 Timothy 1:19-20 \"holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith. Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.\"</blockquote>\r\nIn that day, \"to hand over to Satan,\" was a common term for \"kicking out of the church.\" The picture behind it was that Satan was the ruler of the world, but the church was under God's protection and favor. So for Paul to remove him from the fellowship of believers was to leave him to the whims of the world.\r\n\r\nThese two men were the same ones in <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+2%3A17-18&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+2%3A17-18&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">2 Timothy 2:17-18</a> who were not teaching gospel truth and leading people astray. Also in <a title=\"2 Timothy 4:14\" href=\"14\" target=\"_blank\">2 Timothy 4:14</a> they persecuted Paul during his stay and strongly opposed Paul's message. He was also the spokesperson in <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+19&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+19&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Acts 19</a>, by which there is no clear indicator he was a Christian. From the contents, it seems they may have heard the message of Christ but refused to listen. I think the text shows us that they were false prophets inside the church. One scholar says,\r\n<blockquote><a title=\"http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm\" href=\"http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Gill's Exposition of the whole Bible</strong></a>\r\n\r\nHolding faith, and a good conscience..... By \"faith\" is meant, not the grace of faith, but the doctrine of faith, a sense in which it is often used in this epistle; see <a href=\"http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm\">1 Timothy 3:9</a> and the \"holding\" of it does not intend a mere profession of it, and a retaining of that without wavering, which is to be done by all believers; but a holding it forth in the ministry of the word, in opposition to a concealing or dropping it, or any part of it; and a holding it fast, without wavering, and in opposition to a departure from it or any cowardice about it and against all posers: to which must be added, a good conscience; the conscience is not naturally good, but is defiled by sin; and that is only good, which is sprinkled by the blood of Christ, and thereby purged from dead works; the effect of which is an holy, upright, and becoming conversation; and which seems to be chiefly intended here, and particularly the upright conduct and behaviour of the ministers of the Gospel, in the faithful discharge of their work and office: see <a href=\"http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm\">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>.\r\n\r\nWhich some having put away; that is, a good conscience; and which does not suppose that they once had one, since that may be put away which was never had: the Jews, who blasphemed and contradicted, and never received the word of God, are said to put it from them, <a href=\"http://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm\">Acts 13:46</a> where the same word is used as here; and signifies to refuse or reject anything with detestation and contempt: these men always had an abhorrence to a good conscience among men, and to a good life and conversation, the evidence of it; and at length threw off the mask, and dropped the faith they professed, as being contrary to their evil conscience: though admitting it does suppose they once had a good conscience, <strong>it must be understood not of a conscience cleansed by the blood of Christ, but of a good conscience in external show only</strong>, or in comparison of what they afterwards appeared to have: and, besides, some men, destitute of the grace of God, may have a good conscience in some sense, or with respect to some particular facts, or to their general conduct and behaviour among men, as the Apostle Paul had while unregenerate, <a href=\"http://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm\">Acts 23:1</a> and which being acted against, <strong>or lost, is no instance of falling from the true grace of God, which this passage is sometimes produced in proof of</strong>:\r\n\r\nconcerning faith have made shipwreck; which designs not the grace, but the doctrine of faith, as before observed, <strong>which men may profess, and fall off from, and entirely drop and lose</strong>. Though supposing faith as a grace is meant, the phrase, \"have made shipwreck of it\", is not strong enough to prove the total and final falling away of true believers, could such be thought to be here meant; since persons may be shipwrecked, and not lost, the Apostle Paul was thrice shipwrecked, and each time saved; besides, as there is a true and unfeigned, so there is a feigned and counterfeit faith, which may be in persons who have no true grace, and may be shipwrecked, so as to be lost.</blockquote>\r\n<h2>Other Difficult Scriptures</h2>\r\nThere are other scriptures in the bible that seem to speak against eternal security.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/hebrews-6-condensed/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/hebrews-6-condensed/\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 6 - it is impossible to renew to repentance...</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/09/21/hebrews-10-insulting-the-spirit-of-grace/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/09/21/hebrews-10-insulting-the-spirit-of-grace/\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 10 - for if we willfully continue to sin...</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/is-it-hard-for-the-righteous-to-be-saved/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/02/19/is-it-hard-for-the-righteous-to-be-saved/\" target=\"_blank\">1 Peter 4 if it is hard for the righteous to be saved...</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/10/05/circumcision-a-sign-of-faith/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/10/05/circumcision-a-sign-of-faith/\" target=\"_blank\">Ephesians 5:1-12 Will not inherit the kingdom of heaven...</a>\r\n\r\nBut a broader context shows us that these verses are not telling us that a believer's salvation can be lost. I have written thorough articles on each one.\r\n\r\nDavid Cloud writes an amazing and convincing <a title=\"http://www.wayoflife.org/database/eternalsecurity.html\" href=\"http://www.wayoflife.org/database/eternalsecurity.html\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> for eternal security and thoroughly address other problematic scriptures, including the parables of Jesus. I do however disagree on a couple of his points about God's punishment.\r\n\r\nI have not begun to list all the verses in the bible that clearly speak for a secure salvation, but you will find those verses in every book of the New Testament and in the context of numerous statements. However, my favorite is Titus 3 and I will briefly describe it.\r\n<blockquote>Titus 3:5-7 \"he saved us not by works of righteousness that we have done but on the basis of his mercy, through the washing of the new birth and the renewing of the Holy Spirit, 6 whom he poured out on us in full measure through Jesus Christ our Savior. 7 And so, since we have been justified by his grace, we become heirs with the <strong>confident expectation of eternal life</strong>.”</blockquote>\r\nPaul describes salvation as a new birth, which is known to be an irreversible process, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit in full measure, which is stated in John to be with us always. Being justified is also an irreversible process in the same way that a court may not try the same case twice in the case of double jeopardy. It also says that we become heirs of an inheritance, which we know from Colossians and Ephesians can never perish. And that we may have a confident expectation of eternal life. The greek word for confident expectation literally means, \"<a title=\"http://biblehub.com/greek/1680.htm\" href=\"http://biblehub.com/greek/1680.htm\" target=\"_blank\">an expectation of something that is sure (certain); hope.</a>\" So this passage wants us to have confidence in our salvation and tells us that it is certain or sure. When we fear that we may do something one day to loose or forfeit that salvation, we don't have the confident expectation he speaks of.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 6:18-19 \"God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged. We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain\"</blockquote>\r\n<h2></h2>",

          "content:encoded": "Thank you readers for continuing for visit my site! I hope the issues I write about have a wholesome, gracious perspective and help to renew your life in a way that brings peace, enjoyment, passion for God, and freedom.\r\n\r\nThe topic I want to speak on next is confession. We finished discussing Hebrews 6 about dead works/useless rituals and how as long as we participate in these, our consciences won't experience the freedom and confidence we've been given in Christ. Confession, if taken from a wrong perspective can become one of those dead works. Some people teach that you must confess your sins in order to remain forgiven or to maintain salvation. Others don't quite take it so far and only say that a good, healthy relationship with God involves confession.\r\n\r\nThese things seem pious and right, but in practicality do they promote the kingdom of God? I've heard of a few people who would pray that God would not let them die before they had confessed all their sins. They were worried if they died and had some unconfessed sin in their life, they weren't going to go to heaven. Others have taken confession to the point where they could not function properly in public. They would be in the middle of a sports game and would have to confess for having a bad thought. These people took confession seriously. But did they see the fruits God wants in our lives?\r\n\r\nConfession to one another can be useful if you use it properly. It can bring healing and restoration in relationships, it can help us to understand and learn that we are forgiven and heal our consciences of guilt and condemnation. It is not always appropriate to confess our sins, as some of us have probably experienced, sometimes an oversensitive conscience can bring trouble upon ourself and not healing. However, when we make God's acceptance, relationship with us, and forgiveness conditional upon our confession, then confession looses its power to heal our consciences and instead brings conviction and bondage.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 5:1 \"Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ\"</blockquote>\r\nConfessing your faults over and over does not bring you closer to God. God has drawn himself near by his own Hand.\r\n<blockquote>2 Corinthians 5:19 \"For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people's sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation\"</blockquote>\r\nYour relationship with God is built upon the steady foundation of Christ. Whatever is built upon him will be stable. But if you envision your relationship as built off of your flesh (your ability to confess, show good will, and improve your behavior) your confidence will shake. Even when you do well your confidence will shake, for you do not know when you will fail again. You will be like a wave of the sea, tossed and driven by your latest performance.\r\n<blockquote>Phillippians 3:3 \"For we who worship by the Spirit of God are the ones who are truly circumcised. We rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us. We put no confidence in human effort\"\r\n\r\nJeremiah 17:5 \"This is what the LORD says: \"Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the LORD.\"</blockquote>\r\nI'm not saying you will be cursed, merely that your flesh is unstable and not suitable to base God's relationship with you on. So what purpose does confession serve?\r\n\r\nDoes it remind God that we need forgiveness? No! Did you trick God into thinking you weren't going to mess up again?\r\n\r\nIs it there to give you a sense that you've atoned for your faults? What price did Jesus not pay on the cross? Do you think you can do better? Or did he die in vain?\r\n<blockquote>John 9:30 \"When he had received the drink, Jesus said, \"<strong>It is finished.</strong>\" With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit\"</blockquote>\r\nRequiring additional payment to Christ's <strong>finished</strong> work is an insult to Christ. It says what he did doesn't matter or isn't enough. Its called dead works in Hebrews.\r\n\r\nOr is confession there for God's sake, because you've offended him and are waiting for him to decide if he favors you again?\r\n<blockquote>Romans 5:9 \"Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath <strong>through him</strong>!\"\r\n\r\nIsaiah 54:9 \"To me this is like the days of Noah, when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. So now I have sworn not to be angry with you, never to rebuke you again\"</blockquote>\r\nJesus's sacrifice adequately covered your sins, so God does not take offense at you and does not require a constant confession for you to maintain forgiveness.\r\n\r\nOr is confession simply being honest with God and asking for help? That can be wholesome, as long as we don't push it too far, thinking that God will only help us for sins we've confessed.\r\n\r\nSome people confess their sins in chunks, \"Father forgive all my sins up to this point. Even the ones I am not aware of.\" However, they are still only receiving forgiveness for the chuck that they confessed.\r\n\r\nDo you see the problem with this? Confession can be good if we use it wisely. But misunderstanding confession robs us of a very important element in our faith. You find this element all over Hebrews. A clear conscience and confidence before God. The old testament sacrifices continually reminded us of sin. Every day, 'Hi Bob'. 'Hi Joe, lusted again? Weren't you just in here yesterday? And the day before that?' 'Yep, let's get this sacrifice over with.' Each day you were intimately reminded of how many times you had failed. These sacrifices were temporary, they only covered the sins committed up until that point. That's why that had to keep being repeated, because people kept on sinning, even after they had been forgiven.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 9:9 \"This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.\"</blockquote>\r\nJesus's sacrifice was superior because it only needed to be offered once. How could it be offered only once? Because it also covered future sins. You see, if Jesus's blood was like animals, it would have to be reapplied every time a new sin was committed. But Jesus took away sin once and for all (Hebrews 9:28). And since it cleanses forever and doesn't need to keep being redone, we can also have a clear conscience without the intimate reminder of sin every day.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 9:14 \"The blood of Christ, who had no defect, does even more. Through the eternal Spirit he offered himself to God and cleansed our consciences from the useless things we had done. Now we can serve the living God.\"</blockquote>\r\nSince we have clear consciences before God, he asks us to be bold before him.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 4:16 \"Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need\"\r\n\r\nEphesians 3:12 \"Because of Christ and our faith in him, we can now come boldly and confidently into God's presence.\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 10:22 \"let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhen we have boldness and confidence before God, it honors the work his Son did. It shows that we have faith that Jesus did a perfect work in covering our sins. When I approach God with timidity and uncertainty, it actually insults Christ, and does not give me the freedom and relationship that God desires me to have with him. So where does confession fit into the puzzle? When we teach that confession must be maintained in order for forgiveness to be maintained, then we loose our confidence before God. You are never sure if you have confessed all your sins or if you will miss them sometime in the future. And if you did confess every sin perfectly you would be loosing something else. Your clear conscience. You would be so intimately aware of your sin you would be guilt ridden and have no appreciation for the freedom Christ gave you. You would always be afraid that the minute you gave up, you would loose your forgiveness. This cycle dishonors Christ and does not produce the fruit that God wants you to enjoy. However, this theology is not without its argument. And it stems from a misunderstanding of a passage in 1 John.\r\n\r\nActually there are two verses in the bible that talk about confession. But I will address 1 John 1:9 fist.\r\n<blockquote>\"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\"</blockquote>\r\nTo put this letter in context we have to understand some basic church history. I'm going to try to remember the things I learned in college about this. There was a popular belief that was being spread through the Roman and pagan empires even among christian circles called gnosticism. Gnosticism can take on two branching views. One side believed that only spirit was good and all matter was evil. So they forbid people to indulge in anything worldly. They couldn't imagine Jesus taking on a mortal body, thinking he was only a spirit and they didn't believe we could have fellowship with a God. On the flip side of that, some believed there was no such thing as sin or hell and nothing was evil. In parts of John's letters he is writing to address these beliefs that had invaded these christian circles. He starts of his letter saying,\r\n<blockquote>\"<strong>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes,which we have looked at and our hands have touched—this we proclaim concerning the Word of life</strong>. <sup>2 </sup>The life appeared; <strong>we have seen it and testify to it</strong>, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us. <sup>3 </sup>We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, <strong>so that you also may have fellowship with us</strong>. <strong>And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.</strong> <sup>4 </sup>We write this to make our<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+1&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30545a\">a</a>]</sup> joy complete.\"</blockquote>\r\nYou see here, he is a addressing two of the primary beliefs of the gnostics. One which is that Jesus actually came in the flesh, two that we have fellowship with him. Another belief of gnosticism was that because our bodies were inherently evil, indulging in sin was right for it. Or something like that. John addresses this next:\r\n<blockquote><sup>\"5 </sup>This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light; in him there is no darkness at all. <sup>6 </sup><strong>If we claim to have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness,we lie and do not live out the truth.</strong> <sup>7 </sup>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, <strong>purifies us from all sin.\"</strong></blockquote>\r\nRight afterward he addresses the flip side of gnosticism, which is this belief that there is no sin.\r\n<blockquote><sup>\"8 </sup>If we claim to be without <strong>sin</strong>, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. <sup>9 </sup>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from <strong>all unrighteousness.</strong> <sup>10 </sup>If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.\"</blockquote>\r\nSo see here, he is not saying one must continually confess sin. He is not asking them to distinctly confess every individual sin, but to confess to have having sin period in their lives, in a holistic sense. This addresses the belief gnostics had that there was no such thing as sin. What John is saying is that if you don't believe you have sin, you will not seek Christ's forgiveness and you will miss your salvation all together. Keep in mind gnostics were not believers. John says, \"so that you may have fellowship with us.\" Thus we can assume that whoever he is writing to here does not have fellowship with Christ or other believers. However, if we do confess to having \"Sin\" then God cleanses us from \"all unrighteousness.\" This is the confession that you make when you first come to Christ. It is that realization in your heart that says, I am a sinful man, I need Christ's forgiveness. Thus when you confess Jesus is Lord, your heart is accepting his forgiveness for \"all you failures,\" past, present and future. How many times can you be cleansed of \"all unrighteousness?\" He is not referring to a continual practice but a one time confession that cleanses you from all sin. When we come to Christ when becoming a believer, that confession is being made once and for all. Some will say that the verb tense means \"To keep on confessing.\" I believe the proper perspective of this is not to say that each person must maintain a state of confessing, but rather we must consider that this verse is written to many people and that for each one coming to the Lord he must confess that he has sins. Therefore if people are to keeping coming to the Lord, confessions must keep being made for each new person that joins. When you confess, you confess once and for all.\r\n<blockquote>Colossians 3:13 \"When you were <strong>dead in your sins</strong> and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, <strong>God made you alive</strong> with Christ. <strong>He forgave us all our sins</strong>,\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 10:10 \"For God's will was for us to be made holy by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ, <strong>once for all time</strong>.\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 7:27 \"Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins <strong>once for all</strong> when he offered himself.\"\r\n\r\n1 Peter 3:18 \"For Christ died for sins <strong>once for all</strong>, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit,\"</blockquote>\r\nA great resource for this is, <a title=\"Jesus Gives Life Blogspot\" href=\"http://jesusgiveslife.blogspot.com/2007/08/1-john-19.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://jesusgiveslife.blogspot.com/2007/08/1-john-19.html</a>\r\n\r\nNow lets look at the first verse of the next chapter.\r\n<blockquote>\"My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. <sup>2 </sup>He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.\"</blockquote>\r\nHe addresses them as \"my children,\" showing that now he is talking to believers specifically. But he doesn't tell them to confess in order to be forgiven, he tells them, \"if anybody does sin, we have an advocate with the Father.\" He explains that if we do sin, we are already forgiven.\r\n\r\nThe other problem with habitual confession, is none of Paul's letters teach it. If it is so vital to the faith, why are there only two verses that mention it? And this book in John wasn't written till about 60 years after Jesus died. That means there were 60 years where people didn't know to confess their sins!\r\n\r\nDoes this mean we have a license to sin?! Of course not. Sin is still destructive, I am not encouraging sin, I am actually encouraging righteousness by establishing you in God's love through the knowledge that you are completely forgiven. For he who is forgiven much, loves much. Read <a title=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A5-9&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+1%3A5-9&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">2 Peter 1:5-9</a>.\r\n<h2>James</h2>\r\nNow let's look at the word of confession in James 5.\r\n<blockquote><sup>13 </sup>Is anyone among you in trouble? Let them pray. Is anyone happy? Let them sing songs of praise. <sup>14 </sup>Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.<sup>15 </sup>And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.<sup>16 </sup>Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.</blockquote>\r\nNow, when studying this passage I have not yet found a definitive answer to what he's saying. But it does not look like he is saying that forgiveness only comes if you confess. He says, 'if they have sinned, they will be forgiven.' Not 'if they confess, they will be forgiven.' Now I'm going to throw out three possibilities. I'm sure some will find others. One, he's talking about people who are struggling with sin. Telling them that they should admit that they are struggling and ask that people pray for God to restore them and remove the sinful behavior from their lives. This seems to work well with the greek since the words sick means human weakness in a more general sense. And the word 'will make the sick person well', is sozo. Meaning,\r\n<blockquote><b>4982</b> <i>sṓzō</i> (from <i>sōs</i>, \"safe, rescued\") – properly, <i>deliver</i> out of danger and <i>into safety</i>; used principally of God <i>rescuing </i>believers<i> from</i> the penalty and power of sin – <i>and into His provisions</i> (<i>safety</i>).</blockquote>\r\nConsider the verses following.\r\n<blockquote>James 5 \"19 My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, 20 remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.\"</blockquote>\r\nIt seems, in context, he is asking them not just to pray for physical healing, but for freedom from sinful behaviors by confessing your faults and praying to each other.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is that he is talking about admitting your faults to each other and apologizing for wrongs you've committed against each other as a means of restoring relationships. In James's letter, he is focusing a lot on human relationships. Not so much your standing before God, but he is addressing actions that are causing problems in our relationships with each other. For instance, in James 4 he says,\r\n<blockquote>\"What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from your desires that battle within you? <sup>2 </sup>You desire but do not have, so you kill. You covet but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight.\"</blockquote>\r\nHe just finished saying that if you pray, people will be made well, therefore pray. He then said, if you have sinned, you will be forgiven. When we have the assurance that forgiveness brings, we can be humble and open in admitting that we don't have it altogether and glorify the mercy of God. In his statement about confession, I don't believe he is talking about confessing sins to God in order to be forgiven but to each other. But rather, to confess sins you've committed against one another as a means of restoring that relationship.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is he's talking about humility and openness as a fruit of forgiveness. To confess as a means of humility, so as not to give someone that idea that you are more deserving of God's grace than they. When you know you are forgiven, you don't have to carry a pressure on your back of appearing perfect all the time. Since you know you are forgiven you can be honest with your mistakes. Feel free to make you own conclusions about these verses.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he affirms that they are righteous.\r\n<blockquote>\"The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.\"</blockquote>\r\nMy point is, partial forgiveness does not come after each confession. When we confess our sins to God, we are confessing them all once and for all and He forgives us them all once and for all at that time. If we confess to God again later on, that doesn't nullify it, but I don't think that helps us either. However, when your dealing with your struggles, its good to bring a close friend in and ask for their prayers. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading! God bless you and may you have peace in your heart and carry with you the assurance that you are completely forgiven.",

When we come to Christ, we confess our sin (which actually means to agree with).But after we come, He takes away all unrighteousness and we can forever confess righteousness. Religion teaches us to constantly confess our sins to God. God teaches us to confess our righteousness to our sin. This way, we bring the finished work of Christ into the chaos of our situations. We are saying we trust in God more than our circumstance or habit! Keep up the good words brother!",

This article will delve deeper into the evidence for my translation of the above passage. As a quick summary however I will render this passage in a language I can understand and then explain how I got to that translation.\r\n<blockquote>Jon Paul's version: It is impossible for those who have heard and been invited into God’s promised rest, if they ignore His gift to be brought back to repentance from their useless rituals so long as they suppose that Jesus’s death was ineffective or must be offered over and over like their other animal sacrifices both subjecting him to shame and doing themselves detriment. Works that come from love spurred by faith are useful to God and obtain a blessing. But, the useless deeds and rituals of the old covenant are worthless to God. In the end they will be burned.</blockquote>\r\nExplaining this passage requires us to understand the heart of the book of Hebrews since it is a main point the author is making. So what was the point of Hebrews?\r\n\r\nImagine you had grown up your whole life as a jew under the law, obeying every rule and being careful to follow God's word. And imagine that when you had done wrong you were required to offer a sacrifice and cleansing in order to be right with God or God would punish you for your sins. Every time you offered those sacrifices they would intimately remind you of how often you had failed God. Even though it would provide temporary forgiveness, it would do so always reminding you of sin and leave your conscience full of guilt. Your whole life you had been required to perform these deeds and suddenly a man named Jesus had come in and offered a once and for all sacrifice for sins that was supposed to forgive all your sins for all time and void the need for offering sacrifices. Now let's suppose you began to believe in this Jesus but your friends and family didn't. They rejected you, threw you in prison, or persecuted you for your faith. They said things like, \"If you don't offer your sacrifice God will not forgive you. Do you want to withstand God's punishment?\"\r\n\r\nThis was the situation some of these Hebrews found themselves in. They were not sure that they could trust in what this one man Jesus had done and figured they needed to continue to perform the law and do rituals to make themselves right with God.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the letter of Hebrews is to declare the supremacy of Christ and his once and for all sacrifice, the need to no longer perform those rituals, and to encourage these jews to continue strong in their faith.\r\n\r\nThe author does this by taking them back to a time in their history when they faced a similar situation.\r\n<h2>Entering God's rest</h2>\r\nRemember the story of Moses and how he lead the Israelites out of Egypt? It has many similarities to our faith in Christ. The land of Egypt may represent how we were held in bondage under the control of sin. Passing through the red sea represents how we were baptized into Christ's death. And entering the promise land represents how we are to enter God's rest. The author of Hebrews uses this story to illustrate what our new covenant is like.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 3:16-19 <span id=\"en-NIV-30012\" class=\"text Heb-3-16\">Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt? </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30013\" class=\"text Heb-3-17\">And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies perished in the wilderness? </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30014\" class=\"text Heb-3-18\">And to whom did God swear that they would never <strong>enter his rest</strong> if not to those who disobeyed? </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30015\" class=\"text Heb-3-19\">So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.</span></blockquote>\r\nDo you recall the story? The Israelites were promised a wonderful land that God would give them. A land full of blessings they did not earn (Deuteronomy 6:10-11). But when it came time to actually enter the land, the Israelites saw the giants and didn't believe God could overcome them and so instead of entering the promise land they doubted and never entered God's promise.\r\n\r\nLikewise the jews in the time of Jesus were seeing the persecution that awaited them for their faith and they were afraid of entering into God's rest. They were seeing their giants.\r\n\r\nSo what does the promise land represent to us?\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 4:8-11 <span id=\"en-NIV-30023\" class=\"text Heb-4-8\">For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30024\" class=\"text Heb-4-9\">There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30025\" class=\"text Heb-4-10\"><strong>for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works</strong>, just as God did from his. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30026\" class=\"text Heb-4-11\">Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience.</span></blockquote>\r\nThe promise land represents the rest of God. What do we mean by rest? Look at the verse again, \"for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works.\" What kind of works is he talking about? Are we saying we are supposed to follow the sabbath and don't do any manual labor on Saturday?\r\n\r\nNot at all, this is not the literal Sabbath but rather what the Sabbath stood for and we aren't resting from our manual labor in our career once a week but rather from our efforts to make ourselves right with God through the law.\r\n<h2>Dead Works</h2>\r\nThroughout Hebrews you will come across the phrase \"dead works\" or \"works that lead to death.\" Some translations such as the NIV include the footnote \"or from useless rituals.\" Upon first hearing the word you might assume it's a fancy word for immoral sins such as lust or greed or murder. However the context of the book of Hebrews shows that it represents something less familiar to us. The old covenant rituals required by the law.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10:11-14 <span id=\"en-NIV-30145\" class=\"text Heb-10-11\">Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30146\" class=\"text Heb-10-12\">But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30147\" class=\"text Heb-10-13\">and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30148\" class=\"text Heb-10-14\">For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.</span>\r\n\r\nHebrews 6:1 “Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go <strong>on unto perfection</strong>; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God”</blockquote>\r\nHere it means we are to take our faith out of our dead works and instead put faith in God or more specifically in Jesus's death. <strong>Note: this verse immediately proceeds our passage of study leading us to infer that the same repentance he speaks of here is the same repentance he means in the passage.</strong> We can understand the author's meaning of the phrase dead works because he continues throughout Hebrews to talk about perfection coming through Jesus's sacrifice and not the law.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10:1-2 “The law is only a <strong>shadow of the good things</strong> that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, <strong>make perfect</strong> those who draw near to worship. Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.\r\n\r\nHebrews 9:8-9,14 The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing. This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that <strong>the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper</strong>… How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, <strong>cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God</strong>!</blockquote>\r\nNotice the antecedent: the gifts and sacrifices are not able to cleanse our consciences of debt to God and so they had to keep being offered. But Christ's blood does such a good job of making us right with God that it even clears our consciences of the need to continue performing these rituals.\r\n<h2>Why do we need to repent of dead works?</h2>\r\nImagine you went on a business trip and brought a picture of your wife with you to remember her by. And before you went to bed you would kiss the photograph. Now let's say you arrived home and your wife was with you. But instead of kissing her you continued to kiss the photograph. That would be insulting wouldn't it? It used to have life in it but now it is dead because the actual person is there.\r\n\r\nIn the same way God has sent his beloved son to suffer and die for your sins. God had to endure his son being brutally mistreated so that by the kindness of his will you could be accepted. Now you turn around and say, \"I can do a better job. I can pay for my sins by offering this sacrifice or ritual or by trying harder. Your son didn't suffer enough for my sins.\" It's calling what he did useless and ineffective. It's insulting the Spirit of Grace (Hebrews 10:29).\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 5:4 “Christ is become of no effect to you, whoever of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace.”\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+3%3A3-9&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+3%3A3-9&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Philippians 3:3-9</a></blockquote>\r\nThat is the danger of dead works. Not only are they completely useless to you and God, but they actually insult Him. God has no intention of rewarding those works but in the end they will be burned and wasted away (Hebrews 6:8). This is the warning of our passage in Hebrews 6. However, the author assures us that God will not forget our labor of love of the things which are useful to God.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 6:10 \"God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.\"</blockquote>\r\nShowing people kindness and generosity and helping people in need or things which you are not doing to make yourself right with God but you are doing out of the gratefulness of God's love are things which are useful to God and receive a reward.\r\n<h2>Impossible to repent</h2>\r\nSo why would the author say it's impossible to bring us to repentance of those dead works?\r\n<blockquote>It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened... if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.</blockquote>\r\nThis has more to do with a translation error. A more correct translation in the greek would render the phrase \"as long as,\" something we find in the International Standard Version.\r\n<blockquote>and who have fallen away,<strong> as long as they continue to</strong> crucify the Son of God to their own detriment by exposing him to public ridicule (International Standard Version).</blockquote>\r\nOther translations render it as\r\n<blockquote>it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; <strong>seeing they crucify</strong> to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</blockquote>\r\nSeveral greek scholars have noted that the first statement is dependent on the second continuing to occur.\r\n<blockquote>\"and—a point of extreme importance which is constantly overlooked—<strong><span class=\"ital\">so long as it lasts</span></strong> a vital renewal is <span class=\"ital\">impossible\" (The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges)</span>.\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\" align=\"center\"><strong>Robert Dean Luginbill, Ph.D.</strong> - The phrase that follows in <a class=\"lbsBibleRef\" href=\"http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Hebrews%206.6\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 6:6</a>, \"crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace\" (NIV), has to mean something. Furthermore, in the Greek it is actually part of the same sentence as \"who have fallen away, to be brought back to repentance\" (NIV) – which means the two ideas are inseparably related in the actual Word of God. For that reason, to consider the first part in isolation from the first part is impossible – at least for anyone doing anything like honest exegesis. Since the two parts are interconnected, it must be the case that it is precisely because these individuals are \"crucifying Christ afresh\" that they cannot be restored. <strong>So what does \"crucifying Christ afresh\" mean?</strong> <strong>It means to continue sacrificing under the Mosaic Law and saying by one's actions in so doing that Christ has not yet come or that His work on the cross was not effective...</strong></p>\r\nIn that context, taking the participle \"crucifying\" as temporal not only makes good sense but the best sense and the only good sense. Whether one defines the relationship as temporal or causal or conditional, however, the relative time of the participle is established by the basic rules of Greek grammar: it is a present participle, so that it must be taking place at the same time as the main verb (perfect participles have antecedent action as do aorist participles, generally speaking; present participles never do). For this reason, the essential meaning of the first half of the verse is beyond dispute. <strong>It means that the action contained in the participle \"crucifying\" is the problem which prevents restoration</strong>. (<a title=\"http://ichthys.com/mail-Hebrews-6-and-10.htm\" href=\"http://ichthys.com/mail-Hebrews-6-and-10.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://ichthys.com/mail-Hebrews-6-and-10.htm</a>)</blockquote>\r\nSo then what is the author of Hebrews saying? That as long as they don't understand the effectiveness of Jesus' sacrifice, they will not repent of those dead works. Unless they are convinced that Jesus has fully forgiven them, that his sacrifice was once and for all and legitimate, they will not give up on their rituals. Their conscience cannot be cleansed from those dead works. This is why the author of Hebrews then continues to teach on the supremacy of Christ's sacrifice. He believes that when these jews realize how superior Christ is to their sacrifices that they will repent of them and serve God in a way that is useful.\r\n\r\nHebrews 10 drills this point home.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10:18 “And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary.\"</blockquote>",

When I started reading it, I thought, \"I'll bet he'd enjoy Rob Rufus' take on this!\" and then there was the link =o).  That whole three-part teaching is really good.  I 'came across' Rufus' teachings early last December, and have been so refreshed by the Grace of God, God using the teachings to confirm so many things that He's been showing me over the past five years, and deepening the understanding of His Grace in other areas, showing me things I had not seen before.  You might also enjoy this video by Rufus, \"The Wonder of Our Great High Priest\"  http://vimeo.com/30392201 \r\n\r\nIt is so refreshing to see one so young so grounded in the simple Truths of the Gospel; Who Jesus is, what He came to do, what that actually accomplished, and who we are in Him.  Thank you for effectively contending for the Gospel of Grace.  It is so needed on so many fronts in the Body of Christ today.\r\n\r\nGrace and peace to you in our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\n-JGIG",

          "content:encoded": "It can be easy when I am waiting for God to answer my prayer to start wondering why He isn't answering. I start to search for a reason why He won't do it. Unfortunately, if I go looking, I can find a multitude of reasons that people say why God won't answer prayer. \"Three reasons why God won't answer! Ten reasons why God won't answer! God will answer if...\" It seems that our teaching focuses more on how God won't answer prayer than how he actually does. Or at least, He will with some impossible \"If\" that I have to fulfill. I have learned to stop asking this question all together. It's the wrong question. Instead of asking why God doesn't answer prayer, we should be asking why does He answer prayer.\r\n\r\nEvery time I give myself a reason why God doesn't answer, it weakens my faith that much more. That confidence I have that when I ask God for something, He will do it, gets weakened every time I add an \"if.\" \"He would have answered, but I know I don't have enough faith, so He won't. He won't answer that because it was selfish. That prayer is probably not in His will. He hasn't heard me because I haven't prayed long or hard enough. He can't hear me because I have sin in my life. I have to break through some spiritual barrier or he won't hear my faint prayer. Etc...\" We teach, \"If you doubt, God won't answer,\" but we give ourselves dozens of reasons to doubt.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have broken all of these rules and seen my prayers faithfully and wonderfully answered over and over again. I have doubted and received my answer. I have prayed selfishly and been answered. I have had sin in my life and seen God bless me tremendously. I have not persisted in prayer or fasted and seen big prayers answered. I want to say that God has answered the vast majority of my prayers and is still answering them. God does it not because I qualify in my own merits, because he loves me and gives me everything through his son. I have no reason to teach that God doesn't answer prayer! So in these articles, I hope to restore the confidence we have that God will answer our prayers and eliminate some of the doubts we give ourselves.\r\n<h1>Myth 1 - It's not God's will</h1>\r\nOne of the most common ideas we are quick to conclude is that whatever we were praying for was outside of God's will. We limit God's will to things that are \"churchy\" or what the church expects of us. We believe God only answers spiritual things, but not earthly things. We would never dream that God would give a boy a video game or a dirt bike. We tend to label things as spiritual and other things as worldly. Or we think, \"God doesn't give us anything we want. Just what we need.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, God is not a God who is stingy, who only gives things that are \"for his kingdom.\" He wants to be known as a good father who takes care of his children and provides good and fun things for them.\r\n<blockquote>1 Timothy 6:17 “but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.”</blockquote>\r\nGod wants to be known as generous and loving, someone we can go to when we have a need or want. He wants us to be confident that He will answer our prayers faithfully so that we keep coming to him first.\r\n<blockquote>2 Samuel 12 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_samuel/12-7.htm\"><b>7</b></a>Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_samuel/12-8.htm\"><b>8</b></a>I gave your master’s house to you, and your master’s wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah. <strong>And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more. </strong><a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_samuel/12-9.htm\"><b>9</b></a>Why did you despise the word of the LORD by doing what is evil in his eyes?\"</blockquote>\r\nDavid did not come to God first when he had a desire, and instead he tried to fulfill it in his own strength through sin. When we give ourselves reasons why God won't answer our prayers, instead of coming to Him when we have needs or wants we immediately give up on God and try to fulfill things in our own strength.\r\n\r\nI don't want to find sin in my life because I don't trust that God is willing to answer my prayer. If you teach that God won't give you riches, do you strive for it at work? Do you try to give yourself something that God won't? God has given me many things that were not considered \"churchy.\" He's given me videogames, skill at games, first place prizes, etc... He does it because He loves me and he wants to be the source and fulfillment of my desires.\r\n<blockquote>I tell you, if you ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy will be complete” (John 16:23-24).\r\n\r\n“For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. Now suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish; he will not give him a snake instead of a fish, will he? (Luke 11:10-11)\r\n\r\n“You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it” (John 14:14).\r\n\r\n“You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you” (John 15:16).\r\n\r\n“In that day you will not question Me about anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you” (John 16:23).\r\n\r\n“If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him” (James 1:5-6).\r\n\r\n“He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all–how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?” (Romans 8:32).\r\n\r\n“You do not have, because you do not ask God” (James 4:2).</blockquote>\r\nOver and over, Jesus says, whatever you ask I will give. Now some of you may be jumping into extreme hypothetical arguments, \"Well if I asked God to make the world cotton candy, would he do that!? What if I asked him for something evil!? Would he help me murder someone or have favor with my neighbors's wife?\" If you're offended by what I said, then perhaps your missing a piece of information. God is completely good and He can only give good gifts to his children.\r\n<blockquote>James 1 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-13.htm\"><b>13</b></a>When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” <strong>For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone</strong>; <a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-14.htm\"><b>14</b></a>but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-15.htm\"><b>15</b></a>Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-16.htm\"><b>16</b></a>Don’t be deceived, my dear brothers. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-17.htm\"><b>17</b></a>Every <strong>good and perfect gift is from above</strong>, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, <strong>who does not change like shifting shadows</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nGod does not give good gifts some of the time and then shift into giving evil gifts or tempting people with sin. If you ask God for something evil or sinful, he can and will only give you what is good. Let me participate in your hypothetical argument. Let's say a man's marriage is suffering and he is wanting a better spouse. Let say this man asks God for favor with his neighbors wife... God could not do such a thing, instead when that man prayed that prayer God would interpret the desire behind the prayer and give the man the true source of his desire. The Lord would repair and strengthen the marriage so the man was satisfied. This is the nature of what James is saying,\r\n<blockquote>James 4:3 \"You ask and don't receive because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your evil desires.\"</blockquote>\r\nSo let me make myself clear. God promises to give you anything you ask, He submits Himself to that out of His generous heart. But, He is incapable of doing evil and cannot give you something that is evil. But, if you have his spirit in you, you won't be asking Him for those things anyways.\r\n\r\nI think that we are too quick to name something as \"not God's will.\" We think we are honoring his will, but actually we are controlling it. We tell God what he will and won't do for us. We teach people that God will not give you this or that. We say, \"God will not give you riches.\" We think our motives are pure, to honor what is right. But in actually we are telling God what he can and won't do. Who are we to say what God will and won't do? Ask him for yourself and find out. You will be surprised how many prayers that you considered selfish God is actually willing to answer.\r\n<blockquote>“This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. [15] And if we know that he hears us — whatever we ask — we know that we have what we asked of him” (1 John 5:14-15).</blockquote>\r\nI once asked the Lord, \"How do I know what's inside your will?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered, \"If it makes me look good, I'm pleased to give it.\"\r\n\r\nGod wants to be known as a good God who gives good gifts to his children. He wants to be known as the father who blesses his children with health, financial stability, peace, joy, enjoyable gifts, good relationships, many friends, riches, kindness, etc... He wants the world to see us and envy the kindness He shows us. He doesn't want to give us things that are evil, or painful, or sinful. If we ask God to bring harm on us, He won't! He can't! God is a good and generous God, who gives freely to all without finding fault. So soften your heart in his kindness and begin to have confidence that he will answer your prayers, even ones you don't think are worthy.\r\n\r\nNow as much as I want to encourage your faith and prayers I don't want to leave the impression that we should operate in a spirit of entitlement or impatience, or senseless disrespectful attitudes in our prayers. I don't like it when people make demands and expect everyone else to bow down to their will immediately or else they feel cheated or mistreated. Ultimately it is up to God to decide to answer our prayers and when we pray we need to do so respectfully, not with bitterness, not with discontentedness. When we pray, let us pray confidently and in faith. And then let us wait patiently entrusting ourselves to God's will and not feeling a sense of entitlement as if God was under your control. Keep in mind that as much as I do give you good news, I trust that you be sensible in how you use it and don't use your freedom as a catalyst for anything ungodly.\r\n<h1>Myth 2 - If I don't treat my wife well, God won't answer my prayer.</h1>\r\n<blockquote>1 Peter 7: \"Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.\"</blockquote>\r\nIf you've been in church long enough, you will have heard a sermon on how we must treat our wives correctly or God will not answer our prayers. Some people who are not seeing their prayers answered are wondering if they are treating their wives kind enough. And how kind must they treat them for their prayers to be answered? How do they know if that's why their prayers are hindered? Of course, we should by all means treat our wives kind and with respect. And do so out of a cheerful, willing heart. But, I don't believe this passage is saying that God will refuse to answer your prayers otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn that time, people did not see women as equal to men. And I figure some of these men did not think God wanted to include their wives in part of His inheritance. In so believing, they would not give prayers for their wife, but only for themselves. I believe this passage is saying, be considerate to your wives and treat them with respect and as co-heirs in Christ so that you may include them in your prayers. Don't let the full measure of your prayers be hindered by just praying for yourself, pray for them as well. Just a different perspective.\r\n<h1>Myth 3 - There are spiritual forces I must break through</h1>\r\n<blockquote>Daniel 10 \"<sup>12 </sup>Then he continued, “Do not be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them. <sup>13 </sup>But the prince of the Persian kingdom resisted me twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, because I was detained there with the king of Persia. <sup>14 </sup>Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future, for the vision concerns a time yet to come.”</blockquote>\r\nAgain, some people believe there is a barrier between God and their prayers and that they have to fight to break through that barrier. They have all kinds of methods to achieve this, fasting, praying many times, speaking breakthrough, etc... Could Daniel have achieved breakthrough through any of these means? He continually humbled himself, but the angel said he started coming since the first day. My point with that is, it wasn't his battle. There was nothing he could do to speed it up. Does this mean we should be worried about spiritual forces blocking our prayers? Not at all. In the old covenant we believe there were spiritual forces that resisted our prayers, and delay came because our prayers were under attack. However, I submit that since Christ came and died on the cross, those spiritual forces in the heavenly realms have been defeated and God has come near to hear our prayers.\r\n<blockquote>Revelations 12:10, 12 \"Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: \"Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down. Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.\"\r\n\r\nColossians 2:15 \"And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.\"\r\n\r\nMark 1:15 \"\"The time has come,\" he said. \"The kingdom of God is near.\"</blockquote>\r\nI believe the devil is no longer in heaven resisting your prayers. I believe if he has any work in your prayers, it's to convince you not to pray at all. To convince you that God won't answer, or will take a long time to answer, or that you must repeat the same prayer endlessly over and over in order to fight forces that are already defeated. He wants you to think God can't hear your prayers and try to pull you into all kinds of religious rituals in order to attain something that is already freely given to you. The kingdom of heaven is here. When John the Baptist preached, it was coming, but when Christ died on the cross, his kingdom was established. This means God is not far away somewhere in the universe away from your prayers. This means He is near! And He has come to answer your prayers and has removed those spiritual forces that separated you. That's why Jesus taught that a man may ask and receive, because God's kingdom was near!\r\n\r\nCheck out <a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/what-hinders-prayer-part-2/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/what-hinders-prayer-part-2/\">part 2 on prayer</a>.",

          "content:encoded": "<h1>Myth 4 - Because of my sin, my prayers cannot be heard.</h1>\r\nWe know in the old covenant, God would only hear prayers if the people repented of their sins and did right.\r\n<blockquote>2 Chronicles 7:14 \"if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.\"</blockquote>\r\nThese people were under the law. Their sins were not forgiven and God was relating to them under the basis of the law. Notice how when God lead the Israelites out of Egypt, no one died till the the law was given. Even though they complained and murmured, God only blessed them. However, after the law was given, when they complained and murmured God cursed them, because murmuring and complaining is a sin. So you see, under his grace, he did not treat them according to their sins, however when his covenant of law was established, he was obligated to relate to them on the basis of their sin.\r\n\r\nUnder the new covenant, God has forgiven all our sins, and we have \"humbly\" received and sought Jesus. We have repented of our unbelief and self-righteousness and have accepted the grace, forgiveness, and righteousness of God. Righteousness that comes as a free gift.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 8:12 \"For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.\"\r\n\r\nPsalm 32:2 \"Blessed is the man whose sin the LORD does not count against him\"\r\n\r\nActs 13:39 \"Through him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses.\"\r\n\r\nJames 5:16 \"The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 5:17 \"For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the <strong>gift of righteousness</strong> reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 1 \"1 Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 5:20 \"God's law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God's wonderful grace became more abundant.\"\r\n\r\nColossians 2:13-14 \"When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins, having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross.\"</blockquote>\r\nGod has given you His righteousness and unmerited favor because of what Jesus did for you. He has justified you apart from your performance and not counted your sins against you. Therefore your prayers are powerful and effective. And even when you sin, God's grace is not hindered but becomes \"more abundant!\" Does this mean we should sin? By no means! It is no longer in our nature! I want to prove how there is no more separation from the believer towards God.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10 \"1 The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship... <sup>19 </sup>Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, <sup>20 </sup>by a <strong>new and living way opened for us through the curtain</strong>, that is, his body,<sup>21 </sup>and since we have a great priest over the house of God, <sup>22 </sup>let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. <sup>23 </sup>Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess,for he who promised is faithful.\"</blockquote>\r\nYou see the veil that separated sinful man from God has been taken down by Christ, so that now we may, \"approach the throne of grace in boldness to find help in time of need\" (Hebrews 4:16). This means God gives freely to us apart from our sinfulness.\r\n<blockquote>James 1:5 \"If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask <strong>God, who gives generously to all without finding fault</strong>, and it will be given to him.\"</blockquote>\r\nAm I encouraging sin? By no means! But I am encouraging your prayers. Even when you have sin in your life, you may boldly approach the throne of grace and receive the answers to your prayers, not based on your own righteousness, but based on the righteousness Christ provides for you. Let me address another verse on this.\r\n<blockquote>1 John 3 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-21.htm\"><b>21</b></a>Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-22.htm\"><b>22</b></a>and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-23.htm\"><b>23</b></a>And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us.\"</blockquote>\r\nHere I believe he is not saying that our prayers are limited by how good we've been, but that we have confidence before God because we know we are his children because we see good deeds in our lives. This is why our hearts don't condemn us. And we receive when we pray because we are his children. Let me back up and help put this passage in context:\r\n<blockquote>1 John 3<b> <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-9.htm\">9</a></b>No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God’s seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-10.htm\"><b>10</b></a>This is how we know who the <strong>children of God</strong> are and who the children of the devil are: <strong>Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God</strong>; nor is anyone who does <strong>not</strong> <strong>love his brother</strong>...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-14.htm\"><b>14</b></a><strong>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers</strong>. Anyone who does not love remains in death...\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-18.htm\"><b>18</b></a>Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-19.htm\"><b>19</b></a><strong>This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-20.htm\">20</a>whenever our hearts condemn us.</strong> For God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-21.htm\"><b>21</b></a>Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-22.htm\"><b>22</b></a>and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_john/3-23.htm\"><b>23</b></a>And this is his command: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us.\"</blockquote>\r\nEven when our hearts condemn us when we do wrong we can set it to rest because we know we are children of God because we see his love in our hearts and actions. Therefore we boldly approach him receiving from Him everything as His children. So this passage equates obeying his commands as being children of God. He is not saying if you sin God will not answer. He is saying that if we are children of God we receive anything we ask. And we know we are his children because we obey his commands.\r\n\r\nLet's look at another passage\r\n<blockquote>Acts 3:11 \"While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon’s Colonnade. <sup>12 </sup>When Peter saw this, he said to them: “Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our <strong>own power or godliness</strong> we had made this man walk?<sup>13 </sup>The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has <strong>glorified his servant Jesus</strong>.</blockquote>\r\nSee here, God did not work the miracle because of their own godliness, he did it to honor what Jesus did.\r\n<blockquote>Isaiah 53:5 \"But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and <strong>by his wounds we are healed</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhen God does miracles today, unlike the old covenant, he is not waiting for you to repent before he works miracles. But instead, he goes ahead and blesses you on the basis of his son, and his goodness leads you to repentance.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 2:4 \"Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance?\"</blockquote>\r\nGod does not withhold his goodness from you until you repent, he releases it before you repent.\r\n<blockquote>Luke 5:4-10 \"<sup>4 </sup>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,“Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.”\r\n\r\n<sup>5 </sup>Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.”\r\n\r\n<sup>6 </sup>When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. <sup>7 </sup>So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.\r\n\r\n<sup>8 </sup>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” <sup>9 </sup>For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, <sup>10 </sup>and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners.\"</blockquote>\r\nSo God doesn't do miracles on the basis of our merits or works, but on the basis of grace, to honor his son!\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 3:5 \"So does the one providing you with the Spirit and working miracles among you do this by you doing the works of the Law or by you believing what you heard?\"</blockquote>\r\n<h1>Myth 4 - I have to pray over and over for God to hear me</h1>\r\n<blockquote>Luke 11:9 \"So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.\"</blockquote>\r\nAs some of us have heard, the verb \"ask,\" \"seek,\" and \"knock\" are a greek tense that means to ask and keep on asking. To seek and keep on seeking. Some have concluded from this that God expects you to ask over and over in order to hear you. Let's look at his in context.\r\n\r\nJohn Sheasby gave a great sermon on this material. <a title=\"John Sheasby's Site\" href=\"http://www.liberatedliving.com/\" target=\"_blank\">John Sheasby's Site</a>. I'm spreading his message Luke 11 says,\r\n<blockquote>Luke 11 \"5 Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose you have <b>a friend</b>, and you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread; 6 a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.’ 7 And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, <b>and my children and I are in bed</b>. I can’t get up and give you anything.’ 8 I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your <i>persistence</i> he will surely get up and give you as much as you need. 9 “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 10 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. 11 “Which of you fathers, if <b>your son </b><i>asks</i> for a fish, will give him a snake instead? 12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 13 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”</blockquote>\r\nSo now let me ask you a question. Are you the friend on the outside having to persist in asking to receive gifts from God or are you one of the children in bed with your father? The friend must persist to receive. The child simply has to ask. I have heard this passage taught as, \"You must persist in prayer! If you don't persist, God won't hear you.\" It seems there is a certain number of times you must pray in order for your prayer to be answered. Let me ask you another question. How many times do you think you must pray in order to be heard?\r\n\r\nOnce?\r\n\r\nPeople pray for the same thing over and over because they think God did not hear them the first time. God does not neglect the prayer for the righteous. He is not deaf, he will answer their prayers. Jesus's point in this passage was not to say there is a certain number of times you must pray in order for God to hear you. What he is saying is that, if the evil man who cares nothing for the asker will grant him his request because of persistence, how much more so will the good father, who cares deeply for you, grant your request. Even if God didn't care for you or your prayer He would still answer your request just to get you to stop bugging Him. Jesus is trying to give the people confidence that God will answer their prayer, not to tell them He won't.\r\n\r\nSo this \"ask\" and keep on asking is not talking about praying for the same thing over and over, but to continually come to God with all your prayers because he will keep on answering them. Keep asking God all those things you want or need and He will keep on answering those prayers. He's not stopping any time soon. Therefore don't give up on prayer.\r\n\r\nLet's look at another passage.\r\n<blockquote>Luke 18 \" Then Jesus told his disciples a parable <strong>to show them that they should always pray and not give up</strong>. <sup>2 </sup>He said: “In a certain town there was a judge who <strong>neither feared God nor cared what people thought</strong>. <sup>3 </sup>And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’\r\n\r\n<sup>4 </sup>“For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think, <sup>5 </sup>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’”\r\n\r\n<sup>6 </sup>And the Lord said, “Listen to what the <strong>unjust judge</strong> says. <sup>7 </sup>And will not <strong>God</strong> bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? <sup>8 </sup>I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and <strong>quickly</strong>.”</blockquote>\r\nSo in this passage Jesus is describing the unjust judge who keeps putting off requests. The comparison is that God is better than the unjust judge. He does not keep putting off his children's prayers. God sees to it that our prayers are answered quickly. Jesus's encouragement is not that someone must keep asking for the same thing over and over, but that he should never give up on prayer as a whole. He should pray for many different things and keep expecting God to answer them and quickly. I want to pause on that comment and say, \"We don't earn our prayers through our display of patience, rather we have patience because we have hope! And we have hope because God does not exasperate or discourage his children by taking a long time to answer their prayers!\" So realize that long waits are not God's will. He does not want you to be discouraged with a long wait, He answers quickly. So then have this hope, and be filled with enduring patience and trust. Now let's get back on subject and finish out this message.\r\n<blockquote>\"When you pray, don't babble on and on as people of other religions do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again\" (Matthew 6:7).</blockquote>\r\nI'm not against you praying multiple times for the same thing. But don't put your faith into your many words. Believe God has heard you every time you pray and be confident till He answers by trusting in his Word, \"that you will receive.\" Put your faith in what scripture says over your experience and you will see scripture fulfilled over your experience. Here is another article of mine about asking. <a title=\"Ask and it will be given\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/ask-and-it-will-be-given/\" target=\"_blank\">Ask and it will be given to you</a>.\r\n\r\nCheck out <a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/what-hinders-prayer-part-3/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/what-hinders-prayer-part-3/\">part 3 on prayer</a>.",

          "content:encoded": "<h1>Myth 6 - If I doubt, God won't answer</h1>\r\n<blockquote>James 1 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-5.htm\"><b>5</b></a>If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-6.htm\"><b>6</b></a>But when he asks, he must <strong>believe and not doubt</strong>, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-7.htm\"><b>7</b></a>That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; <a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-8.htm\"><b>8</b></a>he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.\"\r\n\r\nMark 11 \"<sup>23 </sup>“Truly<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A23&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-24664a\">a</a>]</sup> I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and <strong>does not doubt in their heart</strong> but believes <strong>that what they say will happen</strong>, it will be done for them.\"</blockquote>\r\nThese two passages suggest that if you doubt, that God will not answer your prayer. However examine this next passage.\r\n<blockquote>Mark 9:22 \"But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.” <sup>23 </sup>“‘If you can’?” said Jesus. “Everything is possible for one who believes.” <sup>24 </sup>Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “<strong>I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!</strong>” <sup>25 </sup>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. “You deaf and mute spirit,” he said, “I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.” <sup>26 </sup>The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, “He’s dead.”<sup>27 </sup>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.\"</blockquote>\r\nJames says that if a man doubts, he won't receive. However this man had unbelief, yet Jesus forgave the doubt and went ahead and answered the prayer. On what basis could he do this? He was not acting on the man's faith but on grace. Consider when he raised Lazarus from the dead.\r\n<blockquote>John 11 \"<sup>38 </sup>Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. <sup>39 </sup>Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to Him, “<strong>Lord, by this time there is a stench, for he has been <i>dead</i> four days</strong>.” <sup>40 </sup>Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?” <sup>41 </sup>Then they took away the stone <i>from the place</i> where the dead man was lying.<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+11%3A38-44&amp;version=NKJV#fen-NKJV-26565a\">a</a>]</sup> And Jesus lifted up <i>His</i> eyes and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me. <sup>42 </sup>And I know that You always hear Me, but because of the people who are standing by I said <i>this,</i> that they may <strong>believe that You sent Me</strong>.” <sup>43 </sup>Now when He had said these things, He cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come forth!” <sup>44 </sup>And he who had died came out bound hand and foot with grave clothes, and his face was wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Loose him, and let him go.”\"</blockquote>\r\nSee that the people did not believe Jesus would raise him, yet Jesus raised him anyways not because of their doubt, but because Jesus wanted them to know God had sent him. How do these verses reconcile? We are going to look into several passages about faith and doubt and hopefully a bigger picture will form that will clear up this paradox.\r\n\r\nNow, we know the disciples did many miracles, and we know there were a couple instances in the gospels where they could not perform a miracle.\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 17 \"<sup>17 </sup>“You <strong>unbelieving and perverse generation</strong>,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.” <sup>18 </sup>Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed at that moment.<sup>19 </sup>Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, “Why couldn’t we drive it out? <sup>20 </sup>He replied, “<strong>Because you have so little faith</strong>. Truly I tell you, if you have <strong>faith as small as a mustard seed</strong>, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.” <sup>[21]</sup></blockquote>\r\nWhen the disciples couldn't drive the demon out, Jesus came behind them and did it for them. Do you think it's funny that when the disciples asked Jesus why they couldn't drive it out, Jesus said, \"Because you had so little faith,\" and then described how they only needed a mustard seed? The answer to interpreting this verse is found in the old testament reference he quotes from Deuteronomy 32.\r\n<blockquote>Deuteronomy 32:15 \"\r\n\r\n\"<strong>They abandoned the God who made them</strong>\r\n<strong>    and rejected the Rock their Savior.</strong>\r\n<sup>16 </sup>They made him jealous with their foreign gods\r\nand angered him with their detestable idols.\r\n<sup>17 </sup>They sacrificed to false gods, which are not God—\r\ngods they had not known,\r\ngods that recently appeared,\r\ngods your ancestors did not fear.\r\n<sup>18 </sup>You deserted the Rock, who fathered you;\r\nyou forgot the God who gave you birth.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n<sup>19 </sup>The Lord saw this and rejected them\r\nbecause he was angered by his sons and daughters.\r\n<sup>20 </sup>“I will hide my face from them,” he said,\r\n“and see what their end will be;\r\n<strong>for they are a perverse generation,</strong>\r\n<strong>    children who are unfaithful</strong>.\r\n<sup>21 </sup>They made me jealous by what is no god\r\nand angered me with their worthless idols.\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\nJesus quotes from here when he says,\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 17 \"17 “You <strong>unbelieving and perverse generation</strong>,” Jesus replied, “how long shall I stay with you?\"</blockquote>\r\nThis perverse and unbelieving generation rejected their savior and instead worshipped idols. I believe that Jesus was not rebuking them for not believing that their prayers would be answered, but rebuking them for not believing he was the Son of God. They hadn't put their faith \"in him.\" Hold on to me for a second, it should get more clear. Now let's look at when the disciples asked Jesus to increase their faith. He said that they only needed a mustard seed again.\r\n<blockquote>Luke 17 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/17-5.htm\"><b>5</b></a>The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” <a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/17-6.htm\"><b>6</b></a>He replied, “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhy would Jesus be content with their faith if they had just shown that they didn't have enough? Why is it that only a mustard seed was required, yet the disciples still couldn't perform the miracle? I believe he was talking about a different kind of faith than the definition we are familiar with. Not so much a confidence that what they say will happen, but faith that Jesus was the Christ. Notice, that even though they were performing miracles through faith and power, they had never done them through the name of Jesus.\r\n<blockquote>John 16:24 \"Until now you have not asked for anything <strong>in my name</strong>. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe amazing thing about this name is, as I will explain, it overrides our lack of faith, because you are no longer asking God for things based on your own merits or faith but based on Christ's merits and faith. This is what I believe Jesus meant by \"this kind can come out only by prayer.'\r\n<blockquote>Mark 9:28 \"After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” <sup>29 </sup>He replied, “This kind can come out only by prayer.\"\"</blockquote>\r\nWhat kind of prayer could he talking about? Praying or asking in the name of Jesus.\r\n<blockquote>Acts 3:11-13,16 \"While the man held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon’s Colonnade. <sup>12 </sup>When Peter saw this, he said to them: “Fellow Israelites, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our <strong>own power or godliness</strong> we had made this man walk?<sup>13 </sup>The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has <strong>glorified his servant Jesus</strong>...<sup>16 </sup>By faith in the <strong>name of Jesus</strong>, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus’ name and <strong>the faith that comes through him</strong> that has completely healed him, as you can all see.\"</blockquote>\r\nIf I ask in my own name, is ask God on the basis of my own merits and faith/doubt. But if I ask on the basis of Jesus's name, I am asking based on Jesus's merits and faith. When I do that, I receive whatever I prayed for, not because I had enough faith, but because the faith that Jesus has for that miracle was counting towards me through grace. This is what I felt like the Lord said to me, \"Whatever I don't give you because of your faith, I will give you because of my grace.\"\r\n\r\nLook at how he described what belief looks like before he talked about the name of Jesus.\r\n<blockquote>Mark 11 \"<sup>23 </sup>“Truly<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+11%3A23&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-24664a\">a</a>]</sup> I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and <strong>does not doubt in their heart</strong> but believes <strong>that what they say will happen</strong>, it will be done for them.\"</blockquote>\r\nThis verse makes no mention of Jesus, its based on confidence that what you say will happen. Then later in John, he starts describing faith differently. Not faith in what we say, but faith in Jesus himself. And he makes no mention about doubt being an issue.\r\n<blockquote>John 14 \"<sup>12 </sup>Very truly I tell you, whoever believes <strong>in me</strong> will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. <sup>13 </sup>And <strong>I will do</strong> whatever you ask <strong>in my name</strong>, so that the Father may be <strong>glorified in the Son</strong>. <sup>14 </sup>You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.\"</blockquote>\r\nNotice that the focus of this verse is not on your confidence in what you say. He says, 'whatever you ask' and 'I will do' for whoever believes 'in me.' The focus is on believing in Christ. My thought on this is that without Christ, without asking in 'his name,' our own faith is the supply for the miracle. If we have enough faith, it will happen, and if we doubt, the prayer won't be answered. But, what I feel like he is saying here, is that now we have a special privilege we did not have before. That privilege is that instead of asking according to our limited faith, we may ask in the name of Jesus. And when we ask him, HE does the miracle and HIS faith is what answers our requests. He has doubtless faith for us! This is what I fell like the Lord told me, \"When you believe in my Son, I credit all faith to your account.\" So Jesus showed them the steep requirements for an answered prayer, and then fulfilled it by saying that he was the way to get it.\r\n\r\n(By the way, you don't have to actually use the words, \"in Jesus's name.\" There's no harm in it, but God can discern the motives in your prayers and understand if you are asking through Jesus's work even if you don't use the words. Its a matter of your heart crediting the work to Jesus.)\r\n\r\nLet's look at an instance of doubt. There was one town where Jesus could not do many miracles because of their lack of faith and offense. Lacking faith, was not the only problem, as we know Jesus did many miracles to people with little faith.\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 8:26 \"He replied, \"You of little faith, why are you so afraid?\" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe problem was this town neither had faith nor believed that Jesus was the Son of God or put their trust in him (Mark 6). I submit that the faith that God really desires is faith that Jesus is His son. When we believe that, God credits his faith as our own. But when I don't believe in Jesus I'm limited to my own merits and doubt.\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 3:5 \"I ask you again, does God give you the Holy Spirit and work miracles among you because you obey the law? Of course not! <strong>It is because you believe the message you heard about Christ</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nThis town did not believe the message about Christ coming from God. God works miracles not by our obedience, but because we believed in his son. But if I believe in Christ (meaning I am a christian), God accredits me with all faith on account of Jesus! Jesus took all my sin at the cross.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 14:23 \"everything that does not come from faith is sin.\"</blockquote>\r\nThis includes my doubt. Just as God has forgiven me my sins, erased and forgotten them never to remember, so my doubt has been removed from his eyes!\r\n\r\nI want to quote a paragraph from Aram225 out of the article I included above.\r\n<blockquote>\"Faith and believing are not two separate things.  They are the same thing, the only difference is that when we point our believing to Jesus the Son of God and His finished work God counts that as faith.  <strong>Genesis 15:6</strong> “<em><sup>6 </sup>And he believed in the Lord, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.</em>”  In other words as we call on the name of Jesus and believe in Him God accounts that to us as righteousness.  We receive the gift of righteousness. And this gift of righteousness is also called the breastplate of faith and love.  The minute we point our believing to Jesus as the Son of God and receive His salvation God changes our believing to faith.  This is all done through His grace.  <em><strong>Ephesians 2:8-9</strong> <sup>8 </sup>For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, <sup>9 </sup>not of works, lest anyone should boast. </em>This is the measure of faith that God gives to all that believe in His Son (<strong>Romans 12:3</strong>).  When we look at the words ‘believe’ and ‘faith’ in the Hebrew that is when we see the beauty of this free gift through the grace of God. In Hebrew believe is ‘<strong>aman</strong>‘  <strong>אָמַן </strong>and faith is ‘<strong>amanah</strong>‘ <strong> אֲמָנָה. </strong>The only difference between believe and faith is the last letter (the one on the left), it is the letter ‘Hey’ in Hebrew, the fifth letter in the Hebrew alphabet which stands for God’s grace. When we point our believing to Jesus, the Son of God He adds to us His grace that changes our believing to faith (our measure of faith that God gives to all).  Believing in Jesus gives you His perfect faith as you are now the righteousness of God in Christ.  And that is why it only needs to be the size of a mustard seed, you now have the perfect faith of Jesus to move mountains as you believe in Him and His finished work.\"</blockquote>\r\nIsn't that wonderful! God once said this to me, \"I can spot of mustard seed of faith within a mountain of doubt.\" When we believe in Jesus, God erases our doubt from his eyes.\r\n\r\nNow let's turn back to that passage in James.\r\n<blockquote>James 1 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-5.htm\"><b>5</b></a>If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-6.htm\"><b>6</b></a>But when he asks, he must <strong>believe and not doubt</strong>, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-7.htm\"><b>7</b></a>That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; <a href=\"http://bible.cc/james/1-8.htm\"><b>8</b></a>he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe picture James is painting is that God gives freely to all without finding fault (which I believe includes our doubt). This is a picture unique to the new testament as God would find fault with Israel before he would answer their prayers under the old covenant. Now Christ's death and resurrection has enabled us to receive freely from the Father. The faith that God expects is faith that looks to his son Jesus for everything. When we try to merit it, even by 'our faith' we are taking our eyes off of Jesus and are like Peter when he sunk while walking on the waves. Those who doubt are those who take their eyes off of Jesus in offense and reject the idea that God gives freely through Christ and instead they believe they must earn their blessings through law keeping or whatever they consider deserving. So instead of asking in Jesus's name, they are asking in their own!\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 3:12 \"The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, \"The man who does these things will live by them.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 4:14 \"For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise is nullified\"\r\n\r\nRomans 3:28 \"For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhen they are trying to earn their prayers through the law, their faith is nullified because they are not asking God to bless them freely in honor of Christ but instead according to their merits. And they cannot receive on that basis. They are double minded men, somewhat believing in Christ, but still believing that they have to earn what God freely gives them. Jesus instructed us to ask in his name, not ours. God wants to give freely to us through Christ, and when I ask him to \"pay me\" for my service on the basis of myself, I do not qualify.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 11:35 “Who has ever given to God, that God should repay them?”</blockquote>\r\nThey can never receive God's promise on the basis of the law because the law brings wrath not promise (Romans 4:15). These people never feel worthy to ask God for his blessings and instead keep delaying their reception of it till after they feel worthy. Consider the older son in this parable\r\n<blockquote>Luke 15 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/15-22.htm\"><b>22</b></a>“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/15-23.htm\"><b>23</b></a>Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/15-24.htm\"><b>24</b></a>For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/15-25.htm\"><b>25</b></a>“Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/15-26.htm\"><b>26</b></a>So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/15-27.htm\"><b>27</b></a>‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/15-28.htm\"><b>28</b></a>“The older brother became <strong>angry and refused to go in</strong>. So his father went out and pleaded with him.<a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/15-29.htm\"><b>29</b></a>But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years <strong>I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders</strong>. Yet <strong>you never gave me even a young goat</strong> so I could celebrate with my friends. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/15-30.htm\"><b>30</b></a>But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/15-31.htm\"><b>31</b></a>“ ‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and <strong>everything I have is yours</strong>. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/luke/15-32.htm\"><b>32</b></a>But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ ”</blockquote>\r\nYou see, God gives freely! He says, \"everything I have is yours!\" Just like Paul when he says,\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 3 \"All things are yours, <a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/3-22.htm\"><b>22</b></a>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas<sup><a title=\"That is, Peter\" href=\"http://niv.scripturetext.com/1_corinthians/3.htm#footnotes\">c</a></sup> or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours,<a href=\"http://bible.cc/1_corinthians/3-23.htm\"><b>23</b></a>and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.\"</blockquote>\r\nYet the older brother couldn't receive it because he was too busy working to earn something that was already his. And he took <em>offense</em> when the father gave <em>freely and without finding fault</em> to the younger son because he deserved it and the younger brother didn't. Some of us need to stop shying away from God's generosity and begin to take hold of what God freely gives us.\r\n\r\nWhat if I believe that God may give freely but I still have some doubts and am trying to deserve my prayers. Will God answer? Of course! If you even have a mustard seed of faith that God will give freely through Christ, it is enough to nullify a mountain of doubt. This doubt James is talking about I believe is an about outright <em>rejection and offense</em> at the idea of God giving freely without finding fault.\r\n<blockquote>Mark 6 \"Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.<sup>2 </sup>When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed.\r\n\r\n“Where did this man get these things?” they asked. “What’s this wisdom that has been given him? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing? <sup>3 </sup>Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, Joseph,<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+6&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-24411a\">a</a>]</sup> Judas and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” <strong>And they took offense at him.</strong>\r\n\r\n<sup>4 </sup>Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home.” <sup>5 </sup>He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.<sup>6 </sup>He was amazed at their <strong>lack of faith</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nThis wasn't just a town that was skeptical but still went along with Him. This was a town that rejected him completely because of their offense. I believe this doubt in James is for those who would reject God's freedom in giving and have no confidence before him. Therefore when you ask, ask God freely in Christ just as He gives and don't try to merit or earn what is free in your own name. That's an insult to God's generosity. Know that nothing good or bad you do will stop him from answering your prayers because God doesn't find fault when he gives. He gives to honor his son, not your law keeping. That's why its called \"unmerited favor.\" When you take the \"unmerited\" out of grace, it's no longer grace, faith is nullified.\r\n<h1>Then what value is faith?</h1>\r\nThen is faith for my prayers of any value? Or course it is! In fact, when you know God will forgive your doubt you will have even more faith that he will answer your prayers. Faith gives you confidence in God's promises and word. If you are confident in his promises you will be eager to pray, you will have an abiding hope, you will trust in him fully and expect good things. You will have peace in troubling situations, you will stay encouraged and joyful in life. Faith fills your existence with life and confidence! So by all means, grow in your faith and continue to grow more and more confident that he will answer your prayers. My goal is to disarm anything that would hinder your faith. Therefore, don't put your trust in your doubt, but instead put your trust in God's grace. And when you doubt, God will go ahead and answer your prayers, and when you see Him answer, you will have more faith the next time.\r\n<blockquote>John 20:25-29 \"So the other disciples told him, \"We have seen the Lord!\" But he said to them, \"Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it. A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \"Peace be with you!\" Then he said to Thomas, \"Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\" Thomas said to him, \"My Lord and my God!\" Then Jesus told him, \"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\"</blockquote>\r\nEven though Thomas doubted, Jesus still gave him proof. But he said blessed is the man who believes even when he doesn't see. So if you're doubting, don't doubt further by believing that God won't answer. Instead, let him answer and his kindness will lead you to repentance. Then the next time you will have even more faith than before that God will answer.\r\n<h1>Then why aren't my prayers answered?</h1>\r\nMy brief answer to that. They are in the name of Jesus! Or will be. You have to have your eyes opened to see it. If you don't expect good from God, you won't see it when it comes or you won't accredit it to Him. Jeremiah 17:5-8\r\n<blockquote>“Cursed <i>is</i> the man who trusts in man\r\nAnd makes flesh his strength,\r\nWhose heart departs from the Lord.\r\n<sup>6 </sup>For he shall be like a shrub in the desert,\r\n<strong>And shall not see when good comes</strong>,\r\nBut shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,\r\n<i>In</i> a salt land <i>which is</i> not inhabited.</blockquote>\r\n<div>\r\n<blockquote><sup>7 </sup>“Blessed <i>is</i> the man who trusts in the Lord,\r\nAnd whose hope is the Lord.\r\n<sup>8 </sup>For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters,\r\nWhich spreads out its roots by the river,\r\n<strong>And will not fear<sup>[also translated \"see\"]</sup> when heat comes</strong>;\r\nBut its leaf will be green,\r\nAnd will not be anxious in the year of drought,\r\nNor will cease from yielding fruit.</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\nWhen you expect good from God by trusting him on the basis of His grace, you see the good that he brings and accredit it to him. In fact you become so consumed with expecting his goodness, that you can no longer see the trouble in your life.\r\n\r\nIts not good to be hunting for reasons why God doesn't answer your prayer because he does answer. Every reason disqualifies you and shatters your confidence. Instead, put your confidence in the fact that God says that when you pray in his name He will answer. Decide in your mind that your experiences will change according to the truth. Don't give up on prayer! Keep on praying for more and more! You will keep on receiving!\r\n<blockquote>\"He who asks for much shall be given much. But he who asks for little shall be given little.\"</blockquote>\r\nSomething the Lord told me.\r\n\r\nFor more on prayer, see John Long's \"<a title=\"http://siggit81.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/dont-have-a-cow-part-5-prayer/\" href=\"http://siggit81.wordpress.com/2012/10/15/dont-have-a-cow-part-5-prayer/\" target=\"_blank\">Don't Have a Cow Part 5: Prayer</a>.\" He urges us to keep prayer from becoming a work. Prayer is meant to be alive and joyous and a benefit of salvation, but don't turn it into a work or put your faith in it instead of God. Realize that God will bless you with things you forgot or chose not to pray for on the basis of grace and his promises to new convenant believers.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 6:14 \"Surely blessing I will bless you\"</blockquote>\r\nHere is another article along the same lines that help identify what Paul means be <a title=\"http://jonlilley.com/2013/03/03/pray-pray-and-pray-some-more/comment-page-1/#comment-395\" href=\"http://jonlilley.com/2013/03/03/pray-pray-and-pray-some-more/comment-page-1/#comment-395\" target=\"_blank\">pray unceasingly</a>, by John Lilly.",

              "wp:comment_content": "Hmm brother Jon Paul that is a good point but I still feel obscurity around what makes a prayer answered. I'm not trying to pick theology battles but I must say I'm still not sure what exactly Jesus' criteria for delivering a prayer is. There seems no logical consistency to what he answers and what he doesn't. And that's not just me making it up but things we've seen in real life. The problem with saying that imperfect faith gets your prayers answered is that it doesn't explain why people with almost perfect faith quite often don't get their prayers answered. We get a few obscure miracles on Joseph Prince's testimonies but most of the maddening \"faith\" revolutions in America ended very badly-people were so faithful that they stopped their medicine and expected Jesus to heal them...and historically most of them got a big beating by their diseases. I mean, faith can't get much stronger than that right? The second problem with getting people to believe that imperfect faith can give them healing and that it is Jesus' faith that heals them is this-it hasn't decreased their burden. They've only changed from saying \"I believe Jesus will heal me\" to \"I believe Jesus believes he will heal me\". The second is indeed easier to believe than the first, but then I and most others find myself squirming in angst after I've declared it over 100 times with no effect. I've always wondered why God can't give a precise explanation as to what exactly makes the difference between an answered prayer or not. And I'm not here to say that we need perfect faith, because even more puzzlingly people who have no faith at all sometimes get supernatural blessings. Neither Lazarus nor his family expected Jesus to raise him from the dead. And the fact that Joseph Prince keeps saying \"don't disqualify yourself\" doesn't really work. Some people are healed-some people aren't. There's got to be a difference in belief that causes that difference. But what is that difference? It has not been precisely defined, and near perfect faith, imperfect faith or even no faith all have times that they have worked and failed. That's what I don't get. I mean, I'm just asking my right eye to be healed. I'm not asking for a 28 million dollar jackpot.",

It's because I didn't take enough risk to prove my trust. O! It's because I didn't have enough faith... God wasn't willing... etc...\" I do not have a solid answer, but the way I see it is that since we live in a fallen world, not everything subjects itself to God's will, and because of that, problems arise. It not God's fault, it's not our fault, it's simply the fall of creation. However, I don't let that deter me. God is greater than the fall and in fact he does answer prayers. You have given several example of prayers that weren't answered but I've found that the majority of prayers I pray, specific or vague, large or small are answered. We can be partial judges, who pay more attention to lack than the abundance. Sometimes we just need to wait for the Lord to answer. I waited two years for one thing I prayed for. All during that time, I did not think he would answer, and definitely did not have the faith I thought I needed. But in the end I received a huge gift that was exactly what I had asked for. Yes, I don't try to find the answer to why some prayers aren't answered quickly. But, I also have learned not to blame God or ourselves for that lack. What I do have one sense about is this idea that when we are trying to earn God's blessings according to the law, we don't receive them that way. God wants us to ask freely according to Christ's grace and not by our qualifications. I found that when I approached God that way, more of my prayers seemed to be answered.",

          "content:encoded": "<h2>Grace is about Christ and His death and resurrection</h2>\r\nWhat is the message of grace really about? How come it can have a bad reputation? Sometimes its because we are not all talking about the same thing. When I am preaching about grace, you may be relating that to the experience you had once upon a time from another individual who taught grace in a different way. Grace can be abused. When a person separates the message of grace from Jesus on the cross it looses its power. Instead of receiving it in gratefulness the \"idea of grace\" can be used as an excuse to promote sin. God isn't giving us grace because he's gone soft on sin. God doesn't withhold punishment because he's changed his mind about sin. He still hates it. But, he doesn't punish our sins today, because he's already punished them in Christ. And God cannot punish the same sin twice, that would be unjust and it would nullify the work of his son. Sin angers God, but now God sets aside his wrath, not because he has changed his mind, but because he has observed, dealt with, and put away sin at the cross. He has fully released his wrath towards sin on Christ. Now when he turns to you there is nothing but favor. God forsook Christ so that he could accept you. He cursed Christ so that He could bless you (Galatians 3:13). He punished Christ so that he could reward you. Christ became poor so you could become rich! (2 Corinthians 8:9) The message of grace is all about the work of Christ and how it changed everything. It changed the basic wisdom of the world, it changed our standing of God, it opened the doors for such glory! How did it change the basic wisdom of the world? The world's wisdom says if you do bad, you will get bad, but if you do good you will get good. You reap what you sow. Karma. But Jesus defied that law. He did the ultimate good but received the ultimate bad. Why did he receive bad if he did good? Because he was carrying your sins and he was receiving your bad. What does this mean? It means even when you do bad you can expect God to still do you good, not because what you did was ok, but because God has provided you favor through his Son.\r\n<h2>A license to sin?</h2>\r\nThose who claim they are in grace but use it as an excuse to promote sin have not actually received grace. \"You are willing to receive grace good! But did you realize that Jesus had to be brutally killed to give it to you?\" This does not make you want to promote sin. Instead in your heart, you find an awe and overflowing gratefulness and love inside you because of the kindness you were shown. That is always, always, always why the message of grace will produce the fruits of the gospel in your life. The message of grace is not a doctrine or idea, it is the very description of Jesus on the cross and it is the overflow to us from the gospel. Therefore honor his grace by receiving it freely, just as he gives it! Grace is not a license to sin, it is a license to be loved. And God's love will take all roots of sin out of your life.\r\n<blockquote>Luke 17:47 - \"Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhen you receive your forgiveness, you will find love you did not create out of your fleshly strength there, quite by accident. If you were 1 million dollars in debt and someone came to you a paid it off, what would be in your heart? Awe and gratitude overflowing in love or \"I want to go teach people that debt is a good thing?\" Jesus ate the feast of sinners so that you may eat at the tables of his righteousness. I want you to be able to hear what this gospel is all about and not get caught up in the error of immature teaching. The gospel of grace is the gospel of life and if you embrace it you will find life. Grace is not against obedience. Obedience is important, but we must put it in its context. Your salvation, position before God, blessings, righteousness, identity, pleasingness, are not conditional on your obedience. Yes, doing good is pleasing to God, but God separates his pleasure in us from our deeds, so that he can take pleasure in us while even more rejoicing over the good we do.\r\n<h2>A healthy tree produces good fruit</h2>\r\nImagine a healthy tree. You know it will produce good fruit if it has plenty of water, sunlight, and good soil. Obedience is like the fruit of a good tree. Grace is like the water, soil, and light we give it. When you teach grace, you will see good fruits grow. However, sometimes people have it backwards. They think, \"Unless the tree produces fruit, we will not give it water! God will not bless you unless you seek and love him.\"  They focus their teachings on how much God \"demands\" of us. Knowing what God desires is good and healthy, but these people not only focus on good works, they deny or neglect grace in the process. They say things like, \"When you worship you are thinking about what God can give to you and instead you should be thinking about what you can give God. You shouldn't treat God as a Santa Clause just asking for whatever you want. You should be giving God more and asking how you can give him more. God's favor doesn't come to those who rest, it comes to those who strive! You should not expect blessings unless you're promoting his kingdom!\" However the scripture says,\r\n<blockquote>1 John 4:19 \"We love because he first loved us.\"</blockquote>\r\nIf receiving God's love is not foundational, not matter how hard you will to love God you will find yourself burnt out and dry. Loving God is good, but it is only possible through constantly receiving his love and focusing on that. So do not separate receiving God's love from giving it back. Those sayings are essentially saying, \"You plants have been thinking about how you can get water, but you should not be asking for water, instead you should be producing fruit.\" Do you see the absurdity! As soon as you discourage people from expecting good from God and made them slaves to their work, no matter how good or sincere they are, you have turned those deeds into law and you have negated God's love. Plants that don't have sustenance cannot produce fruit!\r\n\r\nBut if you focus on giving the people water, you will see them produce fruit, even when you have not told them to do so. Just like you don't command a tree to produce fruit, when you water it, it will produce what is in its nature to produce. And God has given us a new nature that desires to do good. Granted, part of that nature is obedience and therefore we do need instruction. But, He has written his law on our hearts and minds and that nature comes to life when we receive God's love. Whatever you were called to do, to preach, teach, give, love... that gets released when you drink in and fully receive his grace.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 7 \"<sup>4 </sup>So, my brothers and sisters, you also <strong>died to the law</strong> through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, <strong>in order that we might bear fruit for God</strong>.<sup>5 </sup>For when we were in the <strong>realm of the flesh</strong>, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death. <sup>6 </sup>But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.\"</blockquote>\r\nYou see, dying to the law and bearing fruit to God go hand in hand. Usually when people are teaching obedience there is nothing \"technically\" wrong with their words. However the understanding and meaning they put behind it often smells of \"flesh.\" The word flesh in the greek not only means \"that part of human nature that desires sin,\" but it also means, \"human effort.\" This is the definition I believe he is using here. You see living in the \"realm of the flesh\" is to live according to human effort. The law inspires human effort not the \"new way of the spirit.\"  But when you are free from the law and receive God's love and grace, good works are produced in you, not through your human effort, but through the spirit.\r\n<h2>Reverse Legalism</h2>\r\nDoes this mean we need to be paranoid of our motives, introspective, and worrying about whether we are doing deeds out of religion or grace? Not at all! The message of grace does not produce paranoia. It is not focused on the motives of your deeds. It is focused on receiving God's love. And if you are properly receiving God's love then your motives will change as well. This is another stumbling block in christian circles. Immature teaching on grace has reduced it to a backwards form a legalism. Now instead of trying to do good deeds, you are trying \"not to do\" anything religious. This my friends is not the fruit of grace, they are promoting an outward form of it, but they have missed the heart of it all together. Grace is about letting God be God. Letting Him love me, bless me, give to me, without me telling him He can't. It means, I no longer try to deserve or earn his goodness. I no longer try to merit \"unmerited favor\" (grace means unmerited favor). I let Him bless me freely and I glorify him for that and that when I teach, I teach others that they to can receive freely. If you are pushing for good works, good! But if you are turning those good works into law by reducing God's kindness to them, then you are living in human effort. We are not talking about human effort to achieve good behavior. We are talking about human effort to achieve grace.\r\n<h2>Grace + Flesh = Still Flesh</h2>\r\nThe opposite can also be true. Others teach grace as this... an impersonal power that God gives you... that enables you to no longer sin. There is some truth to this, but there's more than meets the eye. Paul doesn't want us to think that our human effort has somehow become adequate. Let me clarify. Grace will stop sin in your life, but through the kindness you are shown, not through the condemnation of the law or by promising punishment and rejection.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 2:4 \"Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that <strong>God's kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?</strong>\"\r\n\r\n2 Corinthians 3 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-7.htm\"><b>7</b></a>Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, transitory though it was, <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-8.htm\"><b>8</b></a>will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-9.htm\"><b>9</b></a><strong>If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!</strong> <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-10.htm\"><b>10</b></a>For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-11.htm\"><b>11</b></a>And if what was transitory came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-12.htm\"><b>12</b></a>Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-13.htm\"><b>13</b></a>We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to prevent the Israelites from seeing the end of what was passing away. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-14.htm\"><b>14</b></a>But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-15.htm\"><b>15</b></a>Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-16.htm\"><b>16</b></a>But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-17.htm\"><b>17</b></a>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_corinthians/3-18.htm\"><b>18</b></a><strong>And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate<sup><a title=\"Or reflect\" href=\"http://niv.scripturetext.com/2_corinthians/3.htm#footnotes\">a</a></sup> the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.\"</strong></blockquote>\r\nYou see, when are receive our freedom, and get rid of that which hinders it, setting our eyes on Jesus, our actions begin to reflect his character. But when we are focused on ourselves, trying to earn what's freely given to us, sin becomes attractive and our efforts are never enough. When you take God's kindness out of grace and reduce it to this idea that somehow your efforts are enough to achieve God's kindness, then you have taken the power out of it and turned what was meant to be life giving into another demand. This belief is damaging, instead of giving up on their human effort and receiving God's love, they double their trust in their efforts.\r\n<blockquote>Phillippians 3:3 \"For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh\"</blockquote>\r\nPaul does not want us to put our confidence in our ability to do right before God. Grace does not change this. So do not limit God's favor to what you deserve. Grace is an empowerment that stops sin, but I want you to see how it does this. Let me read a scripture.\r\n<blockquote>2 Peter 1 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_peter/1-5.htm\"><b>5</b></a>For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_peter/1-6.htm\"><b>6</b></a>and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_peter/1-7.htm\"><b>7</b></a>and to godliness, mutual affection; and to mutual affection, love. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_peter/1-8.htm\"><b>8</b></a>For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. <a href=\"http://bible.cc/2_peter/1-9.htm\"><b>9</b></a>But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, <strong>forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nYou see, it is not their strength alone that is producing these praiseworthy deeds. It is knowing that they are forgiven. When I say living through human effort, I do not mean that you don't physically do any work. I mean that you do not limit God's love towards you to how well you obey. You can do all the right stuff and miss receiving God's love.\r\n<h2>Missing God's Love</h2>\r\nGod wants works that are done from a sincere and willing heart. However when you are not receiving God's love, what you find is that even though outwardly you are doing all the right things, inwardly you are regretting it, finding no pleasure in it, and wishing you could stop. Your hands are doing what's right but your heart is betraying you. However, if you know God's grace, your heart will agree with your deeds and you can rejoice in the good you do, even deeds that take effort.\r\n<blockquote>Revelation 2 \"To the angel<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-30719a\">a</a>]</sup> of the church in Ephesus write:\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nThese are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands. <sup>2 </sup><strong>I know your deeds</strong>, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.<sup>3 </sup>You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.\r\n\r\n<sup>4 </sup>Yet I hold this against you: <strong>You have forsaken the love you had at first.</strong><sup>5 </sup>Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first.\"\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nThese people were doing all the right things outwardly, but they had drifted from the foundation of their faith which is all about God's love for us. Because they weren't receiving his love, their deeds were dry. This passage is not saying they need to redouble their efforts and try to muster up love for God and prove to him their love. They are like dry withering plants. Instead they need to come to a fresh revelation of how much God loves them, and then they will find love for God in their hearts. This is a picture of what happens when you separate obedience from grace, rejecting grace and demanding obedience. You fall from your first love.\r\n<blockquote>John 15 \"No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. <sup>5 </sup>I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.\"</blockquote>\r\nYou see, it is not our dedication that is achieving God's love. It is God's love that is making us dedicated. That is why in all of Paul's letters he always taught grace first and then taught on good works. Good works must always be taught in context of grace. They have little power otherwise.\r\n<h2>Summary</h2>\r\nCan you agree with me on these matters? We are to focus on God's love for us and make that the primary thing, letting obedience fall into its place, the blocks, not the foundation. I am to water plants before expecting fruit and when I preach I emphasize the kindness of God, not the stubbornness of man. I certainly do not turn those works into law by saying, \"You will not be forgiven or blessed unless you obey.\" Or \"You must focus on giving to God not receiving.\" That drains the gospel of its power.\r\n\r\nWhen Paul preaches on good works he peaches them as a result or a urged consequence of receiving the gospel, never as a requirement.\r\n<blockquote>\"Knowing the good news of salvation (indicative mode), believers are to live a life clothed with love (imperative mode; 3:14). The command follows the proclamation of the good news as a consequence and never as a condition. This order is not reversible. Reverse it, and the gospel is turned into a new law\" (Andrew Purves, The LIfe with God Bible - New Revised Standard Version p.358 [commentary on Colossians]).\r\n\r\n\"Spiritual formation is being formed by the Spirit into the image of Christ. It is the Spirit's work, in the Spirit's way, and in the Spirit's time. The Spirit keeps us free and fruitful. When we draw our life and strength from the Spirit, we are freed from the sinful desires that arise from human weakness (5:16). When we are led by the Spirit, we are freed from the need to earn and perform (5:18). We are even freed from trying to be virtuous by the guarantee of fruitfulness (5:22 and note; John 15)\" (Howard Baker, The LIfe with God Bible - New Revised Standard Version p.325 [commentary on Galatians]).</blockquote>\r\nSo do not be misguided or discouraged every time someone teaches you that instead of expecting from God you need to give more. Or that you must keep doing good in order to keep receiving. God's giving will never stop because it is based on his glory not yours. And your giving will flow out of your receiving and you will even put their deeds to shame by the genuineness that flows from your relationship with God. Keep the roots strong and deep and the tree will be steady! Make sure you are drinking good water and fruits will grow. Always let your deeds be seasoned with life and love overflowing from a heart full of gratitude.  Don't let your deeds grow stale by rejecting or trying to earn what's freely given to you.\r\n\r\nFor more on this subject visit my friend's article on <a title=\"http://siggit81.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/distinguishing-us-from-our-works/\" href=\"http://siggit81.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/distinguishing-us-from-our-works/\" target=\"_blank\">Distinguishing Us From Our Works</a>.\r\n\r\n</div>",

          "content:encoded": "This is a sensitive subject in the church and there are many people who think we need or don't need to tithe. I believe these differences are not of extreme importance, and should not hinder our faith or the way we walk with one another.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 14:1 \"Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quarreling over disputable matters...\"</blockquote>\r\nThe tithe is a disputable area in the scriptures. Few verses talk about it, but it is something engrained into our christian culture. Churches need a source of funding and the tithe fits that need very well. So why am I writing this article? Do I have a problem with that?\r\n\r\nNo, not really. The new testament encourages believers to give wholeheartedly especially to the ministry of the word and promises a reward for that (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+9%3A14&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+9%3A14&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">1 Corinthians 9:14</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+6%3A6+&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+6%3A6+&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 6:6 </a>| <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A16-17&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A16-17&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">Philippians 4:16-17</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A38&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+6%3A38&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">Luke 6:38</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+9%3A10-13&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+9%3A10-13&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">2 Corinthians 9:10-13</a>). It also encourages us to support ministers if they ask for it. However Paul tells us to give as we are willing and able, not under compulsion (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+9%3A7&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+9%3A7&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). He never calls this a tithe and does not suggest any curse for failing to give.\r\n\r\nBut what is unwholesome is when we limit God to our compulsory tithe. When we think we are missing God's blessing because of not tithing or being afraid that if we stop tithing we will come under curse. Every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of Christ we have an obligation to resist (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+10%3A5&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+10%3A5&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>).\r\n\r\nI understand that a lot of people tithe to show their appreciation for God providing for them. It is good to show appreciation to God even if that means giving away money. However, if you call it a tithe then you also infer a curse for not tithing. Such a system has the opportunity to become <a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/hebrews-6-condensed/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/hebrews-6-condensed/\" target=\"_blank\">a dead work (a useless ritual) something we depend on besides Jesus</a>.\r\n<h2>What was the purpose of the tithe?</h2>\r\nThe tithe was part of the law (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+12%3A11&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+12%3A11&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+14%3A22&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+14%3A22&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>). It was a substitute to the Levitical priests who didn't inherit a portion of the promise land like the other tribes did. It was also set aside to help the widows and orphans and the poor and every third year they were instructed to bring the Levites and the poor in for a feast using the money of the tithe.\r\n\r\nBut we know that when God's people did not tithe, God would curse their land (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+3%3A8-12&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+3%3A8-12&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Malachi 3:8-12</a>). We have probably all heard that passage at least once in church.\r\n\r\nSome interesting facts about that passage: opening the windows of heaven was an expression in that day for receiving rain for their crops (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+28%3A12&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+28%3A12&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>). Also, God may not have been specifically angry with the people for not tithing, but instead upset at the priests for abusing the use of it (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+2%3A1-4&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi+2%3A1-4&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Malachi 2:1-4</a>).\r\n<h2>Christ redeemed us from the curse</h2>\r\nNow here's the turning point.\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 3:13-14 \"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.” He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.\"</blockquote>\r\nWe established that the tithe was part of the law. All curses of the law were removed by the sacrifice of Christ! Let's look carefully at one of the symbols in Christ's crucifixion.\r\n<blockquote>John 19:2 \"The soldiers twisted together a <strong>crown of thorns</strong> and put it on his head.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhat does this remind you of? Remember Adam's curse? I believe Christ placed the curse of the ground on his own head!\r\n<h2>Abraham's Blessing</h2>\r\nThe rest of the verse shows that the blessing given to Abraham would come upon us.\r\n<blockquote>Genesis 26:12-14 \"<span id=\"en-ESV-705\" class=\"text Gen-26-12\">And Isaac [Abraham's descendant] sowed in that land and reaped in the same year a hundredfold. The <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> blessed him,</span> <span id=\"en-ESV-706\" class=\"text Gen-26-13\">and the man became rich, and gained more and more until he became very wealthy.<span style=\"font-size:xx-small;\"><span style=\"line-height:10px;\"> </span></span></span><span id=\"en-ESV-707\" class=\"text Gen-26-14\">He had possessions of flocks and herds and many servants, so that the Philistines envied him.\"</span></blockquote>\r\n<strong>This blessing was given without regard to the tithe (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A18&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A18&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 3:18</a>).</strong> When the law came the same blessing was locked up under man's obedience (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+28%3A8-12&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+28%3A8-12&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Deuteronomy 28:8-12</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A10&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A10&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 3:10</a>). But in Jesus Christ we have received this inheritance and blessing from God on the basis of faith.\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 2:16 \"Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 3:9 \"So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.\"\r\n\r\nEphesians 1:11 \" In him we have obtained an inheritance.\"\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+13%3A39&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+13%3A39&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Acts 13:39</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A18&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A18&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 3:18</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A12&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A12&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Colossians 1:12</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A32&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A32&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 8:32</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+1%3A20&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+1%3A20&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">2 Corinthians 1:20</a></blockquote>\r\n<h2>So does the believer need to tithe?</h2>\r\nNow, you will have a very hard time finding a scripture in the new testament that talks about tithing. However there is one in Hebrews, which I want to point to.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 7:4-12 \"Just think how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder! <strong>Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people</strong>—that is, from their fellow Israelites—even though they also are descended from Abraham. This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises. And without doubt the lesser is blessed by the greater. In the one case, the tenth is collected by people who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living. <strong>One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham</strong>, because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor. <strong>If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood</strong>—and indeed <strong>the law</strong> given to the people established that priesthood—why was there still need for another priest to come, one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron? <strong>For when the priesthood is changed, the law must be changed also.</strong>\"</blockquote>\r\nYou see in order to have a tithe, you must have a levitical priesthood to tithe to. But scripture says that perfection could not come through that priesthood and now a new priesthood has come which demands a change in the law. The same law that demands tithes. Shortly after he says,\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 7:18-19 \"<strong>The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless </strong>(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe law that required priests to descend from Aaron and also demanded a tithe has been shifted and now there must be a change in the law because we have a new priest under a new covenant. Now I could give you many verses on how the believer is no longer under the law, but one verse can say the same <a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/no-longer-under-law/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/no-longer-under-law/\" target=\"_blank\">as many</a>.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 10:4 \"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.\"</blockquote>\r\nTithing is not a requirement of faith, it is an obligation of the law. A law we are no longer under. Just like animal sacrifices are useless to remove sins that have already been removed, the tithe is useless to remove a curse that's already been removed! They are both dead works, useless rituals.\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>But Abraham tithed?</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nSome people argue that because Abraham was not under the law and he tithed that it means we must tithe as well. However, I suggest that this passage was meant to be read as a symbol of Christ, not as a law for believers. In fact he did many such symbols. Abraham offered up Isaac as a symbol of what God would do with Christ in offering his son up. Does this mean we need to sacrifice our children? I know its a useless and cruel argument.\r\n\r\nAbraham was circumcised. Does this mean we need circumcision? Circumcision was a requirement of the law that Abraham also practiced before it was given. Paul makes it clear that circumcision is no longer necessary (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2%3A29&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2%3A29&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 2:29</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A11&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A11&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">Colossians 2:11</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A2&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A2&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 5:2</a>). Abraham's circumcision was a symbol of what God would do in the hearts of the believers. It was not to be taken literally as a requirement of believers. Remember the dispute in <a title=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+15%3A1-11&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+15%3A1-11&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Acts 15:1-11</a>?\r\n<h3>So what is the picture?</h3>\r\nWe know the old covenant scriptures speak in code about Christ.\r\n<blockquote>John 5:39 \"You search the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. <strong>But the Scriptures point to me!</strong>\"</blockquote>\r\nThe tithe is a picture of Christ.\r\n<blockquote>Ezekiel 44:30 The best of <strong>all the firstfruits</strong> and of all your special gifts will belong to the priests. You are to <strong>give them the first portion</strong> of your ground meal so that a blessing may rest on your household.\r\n\r\nRomans 11:16 \"If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthains 15:22 \"For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. But each in turn: <strong>Christ, the firstfruits</strong>; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.\"</blockquote>\r\nChrist is our first-fruits. The first in the resurrection which has made the rest of the batch holy. As our representative to God, he makes all of us holy. Abraham tithed the first-fruits of his victory over the kings to rescue Lot. Christ is the first-fruits of his victory on earth, to bring many to eternal life in the resurrection. In a sense, Christ is humanity's 10% to God. Abraham rescued Lot, but Christ rescued us. Now, I would love to learn more about these matters. I'm sure I don't understand everything completely about what the symbol represented but this is my humble observance. Now, let's look at some other reasons, why we should not use that passage as a means to continue tithing.\r\n<h3>Abraham's tithe doesn't qualify us to tithe</h3>\r\n<blockquote>\"<a href=\"http://gill.biblecommenter.com/hebrews/7.htm\">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a>\r\n\r\nTo whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all,.... Or tithes, as in <a href=\"http://bible.cc/genesis/14-20.htm\">Genesis 14:20</a>. Philo the Jew (b) renders the Hebrew phrase, , just as the apostle does , \"a tenth part of all\", or \"out of all\"; not of all that he brought back, as Lot's goods, or the king of Sodom's, or any others; only of the spoils of the enemy, as in <a href=\"http://bible.cc/hebrews/7-4.htm\">Hebrews 7:4</a> which is no proof of any obligation on men to pay tithes now to any order of men; for this was a voluntary act, and not what any law obliged to; it was done but once, and not constantly, or every year; it was out of the spoils of the enemy, and not out of his own substance, or of the increase of the earth; nor was it for the maintenance of Melchizedek, as a priest, who also was a king, and was richly provided for; but to testify his gratitude to God, for the victory obtained, and his reverence of, and subjection to the priest of God.\" (<a title=\"http://bible.cc/hebrews/7-2.htm\" href=\"http://bible.cc/hebrews/7-2.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://bible.cc/hebrews/7-2.htm</a>).</blockquote>\r\nWe see then at Abraham's single act of tithing does not need to be interpreted as an obligation for believers. It is permissible to find a principle of giving to God out of thankfulness voluntarily for the victories He gives you. But it is not an obligation.\r\n<h2><strong>Without neglecting the former</strong></h2>\r\nNow, another scripture that can be a turning point is in Matthew 23.\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 23:23 \"Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices--mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law--justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.\"</blockquote>\r\nSome will say, because Jesus said they should have been tithing we believers need to tithe. However, we must examine the purpose of this passage. Remember that Jesus was born under the law (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4%3A4&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4%3A4&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 4:4</a>). The new covenant was not in effect yet.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 9:16-17 “For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it. For a covenant is valid <em>only</em> when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.”</blockquote>\r\nJesus often examined how the law should have been kept in order to hold the world accountable to God. For instance he says,\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 5:33 \"And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.\"\r\n\r\nMatthew 5:19 \"So if you ignore the least commandment and teach others to do the same, you will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But anyone who obeys God’s laws and teaches them will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.\"\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew 5:17</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A20-22&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A20-22&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew 5:20-22</a></blockquote>\r\nWe know that a believer is saved through faith, and not by how many sins he has avoided (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=TItus+3%3A5-7&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=TItus+3%3A5-7&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Titus 3:5-7</a>). Jesus also assumed that the sabbath was still binding, he only deferred on how it was to be kept (<a title=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A1-12&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+12%3A1-12&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew 12:1-12</a>). Paul later tells us that we no longer need to observe the sabbath (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A16-17&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A16-17&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Colossians 2:16-17</a>).\r\n\r\nWhy did he do this? Because the secrets of the kingdom had not been given to them yet (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A10-17&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A10-17&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew 13:10-17</a>). He was showing the people their need for a savior by bringing out the convicting power of the law (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A19&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 3:19</a>). <a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/no-longer-under-law/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/09/24/no-longer-under-law/\" target=\"_blank\">Believers are no longer required to keep the law since they have been justified by faith</a>.\r\n\r\nJohn Long also writes more on this subject. <a title=\"http://siggit81.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/when-did-the-new-testament-begin/\" href=\"http://siggit81.wordpress.com/2012/08/10/when-did-the-new-testament-begin/\" target=\"_blank\">When did the New Testament Begin?</a>\r\n\r\nSo the picture of the tithe is the same thing. He is defining for them how the law should have been handled and is holding them accountable to God for their neglect. The purpose was not to make a new covenant ordinance, but to bring out the conviction of the old ordinance so their hearts might truly know their need for his mercy.\r\n<h2>Summary</h2>\r\nBelievers are encouraged to give wholeheartedly and as they are willing and able, but are not required to keep the tithe. It is a command that was set aside with a new priesthood and Christ redeemed us from it's curse. When Jesus spoke of the tithe he was not saying that the believer should continue to practice it but using it to show how miserably the Pharisees had failed to keep the law.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nIf after reading this you are still convinced tithing is important for the believer, I will honor you for it. You give to honor the Lord, but I do hope you are doing it out of the willingness out of your heart and not suffering fear of curse. It is ok to give gratefully out of your income to provide the church if that is in your heart to do.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div></div>",

              "wp:comment_content": "No it won't kill you. You do so to honor God, and I'm sure God is honored by that service. But, it's not the only way to honor God. And this ritual risks becoming a dead work for others. If Jesus paid the ultimate tithe with his own body to redeem us from the curse, but we think that we still need to remove the curse through our tithe, we are mocking what he did. Those dead works are actually insulting to God and not helpful. But, what your doing doesn't have to be that. I still recommend supporting ministers and the church with gifts, even if that's 10%, but not for the sake of removing a curse. If you want to serve God, talk to him and find out how he wishes to be served. For instance, imagine everyday I come home from work and bring my wife some flowers. She will show appreciation, but if I never talk to her I may never realize that she doesn't like flowers (although who wouldn't). She appreciates my service, but because I don't know her and what she likes, I'm not serving her in the best way. So I would say, part of being passionate about God is actually finding out what he likes and following that. I'm not saying God doesn't like what your doing, that's between you and God and only he has the right to say so. It's just something you may want to talk to him about. All dead works start with good intentions and they are all supposably made to honor God. So let your giving be joyous and free, not under compulsion. Your donations help to promote the preaching of God's word and is useful to the Lord.",

              "wp:comment_content": "God Bless You. I am also interested to Know more about tithing. But I still have some doubts. I think that the earth is still under curse. Even after you accepted Jesus you still get sick. Moms (even believers) bring their babies with pain. You still have to work for eating. I think in Eden there was no pain, no need of labour to eat. Am I right? It means that Christ did not redeem the earth, He came to redeem men. Does it mean that everyone is automatically redeemed? No. That's why there is still sin, people starving, wars everywhere, diseases, it is because the earth is still under curse. You have to accept  Jesus so that you can enjoy the life Christ has conquered for you. Sorry but I can't agree with your. The earth is still under curse. That's why Jesus said about the disciples \"they are in this world but they don't belong here\". Unfortunately, I am still seeking God to get a revelation about giving. Even in the NT it is not clear if it is to give in the church or to give people.",

              "wp:comment_content": "Tithing was under and is under the law with a curse for Christians seeking salvation under the law. Malachi 3:1-18. Salvation under the law one attains it at last breath on earth having done all that pertains to the law which is hard for one to accomplish. Even the tithe which was given by Abraham was under the law of sin and death from the fall of Adam and Eve. Those who cheat would like to deceive Christians that tithe was before the law but before which law. When Christ was born He was given gifts and not tithes Mathew 2:11-12. Salvation under  spiritual law of love by grace is freely given and attained, Ephesians 2:4 -9, Ephesians 2:13 -20. Under Leviticus priesthood tithes were given for the tribe of Levi and tithe of tithe to the high Priest for they  shared no land apart from the walled towns they were allocated to stay in for their continuous sacrifice to God, Numbers 18:20 -29.Widows, strangers ,fatherless and orphans  benefited from tithes and offerings given to Levites, Deuteronomy 14:22-29. In Christianity widows were asked to be catered by close  brethren to ease burden to the Church. There were also tithes of different kinds  in Israel. There was also a tithe where a family had to eat all before the Lord, Deutreronomy12:6-7. In Christ Jesus we are saved by grace and not by works of law Galatians 3:8-13,Acts13: 38-39, Galatians 4: 4-5, Galatians2:16-21, Galatians 5:18. In NEW TESTAMENT two priesthood are compared Hebrew7: 7-28, Hebrew8:6 -13, Hebrew 9:6-9, Hebrew 10:8-23. Leviticus priesthood under the law with tithes, death, discontinuity and its acceptance under law and the holy priesthood of Christ without tithes, death and discontinuity  under which Christians are in salvation being a  Holy nation and  loyal Priests to preach to the world GOD being their Father, 2Peter 2:5-9. Christ is from the tribe of Juda without priesthood and he never sent any of  the Levites Priests to preach to the world.   Christ is the end of the law of sin and death which was against us having crucified it on the cross of Calvary Roman 10:1-4, Roman8:1-2,Roman 6:13-14 . Christ came to  accomplish all the requirements of the law and became the Lord of the law. Beside the death of the two sinners, in CHRIST JESUS accomplished two deaths . Christ crucified on the Cross the law of sin and death which was against us. Christ then removed the first covenant and established the better Second Covenant mediated BY Him  upon  established better promises for us. All Apostles of Christ never asked for tithes. Even Judas never asked for tithes. Christ Himself never asked for  tithes. In new testament comments are made on tithing under law which some want to use to justify tithing. Our Christian faith is founded on foundation of apostles, prophets ,JESUS CHRIST Himself being the Apostle and Corner Stone of our faith,Hebrew3:1. Leviticus priesthood is totally left out. In the same Spirit Paul referred law as was our and not law is our school master. To justify oneself us paying tithes under the law one has to give tithes to all saved Christians in the Church for we are loyal priests in Christ Jesus presenting our bodies as living sacrifice.  But God does not have pleasure for Sacrifice and offering  and  burnt  offerings for sin neither had pleasure therein, which are offered under the law. A fountain  cannot produce sweet and bitter water the same time. James 3:8-18. We Christian are saved by GRACE IN CHRIST LOVE(Spiritual Law) for we  cannot be subjected to law of sin and death crucified by Christ on cross of Calvary. We are subjected to spiritual law of life in Christ  Jesus and ought to have the spiritual understanding of the Word of God. Roman 8:1-2, Colossians 1:9-10.  As God has blessed us we should give  sacrificially as we have purposed in our hearts in liberty and in  love, Galatians 5:1, 2Corinthians 9;6-7, Galatians 6:6-7, Hebrew6:6-12,Hebrew13:11-16. Christ taught spiritual giving to God and to our parents, Luke 6:8 ,Matthew15:5-9. Paul also taught the same .2Corinthians 9:6-14, Philippians 2:4-5. Aaron was given unto Moses, the Levite  priests were given unto Aaron, the eleven tribes of Israel were given unto Levite tribe to serve them but we Christians are purchased through the blood of Christ we are no mans’ servants but servants of Christ 1Corinthians 7:21-2 , Numbers 3:9-15. Those under the law are under curse. Are they telling Christians curses under law are blessings for them or they have powers to remove curses when Christians tithe to them? They have directed Christians to deceptive ways of curses for their own benefits  and not blessings. The bounty of terror of deceptive greediness is professionally tactically presented as blessing based on salvation under their yard stick of tithes. The  body of CHRIST is talking about the mess they have been subjected to  by Levites priests and pastors. In willful deception by calling themselves the Levites of today who persecuted Christians and plunder Christians pockets today they are  able to demand to be given tithes. Levites priests and elders never gave a helping hand to Christians. Christ did not leave His Church under Leviticus Priesthood. When we take the Word of God out of its content and contest ,we have contempt for the Word of God. He (GOD)who brought tithing  under the old Covenant took it away in His(CHRIST) rights in the new Covenant.\r\n     We can preach the Word of God quoting scriptures like the devil when he tested Jesus or quote the scriptures like CHRIST when He answered satan in time of need. Matthew 4:1-11 We can teach doctrine of men instead of doctrines of God. We can have a zeal  of faith and establish our own righteousness not according  to righteousness of God in the knowledge of his Word. Roman 10:1-4. Pastors and priests calling themselves Levites of today have capitalized on low  level  Christian doctrinal knowledge  teachings among Christians. .Tithing contradict the doctrine of salvation. Mathew15:5-9. We can preach the Word of God making the Church a  house of merchandise  to make merchandise of Christians and those who do so whose God is their belly which made Adam and Eve  to fail in their relationship with God .If the trade was not profitable to them then it would have come to an end but it is a lucrative profitable business to them cunningly preserved with tactical appreciations to the body of Christ and spreading of the Gospel. Are elect Christians deceived? Romans 16:17 -19 ,2 Peter 2:1-3, John 2:16, Philppians3:17-19. We can preach  Christ  out of envy, strife or of good will. Philippians 1:15-17,2Corinthians4:1-2. It is the body of Christ the Church which is sent to preach to the world also as individuals brethren bearing the burden to preach to the world as Apostles of Christ did. The responsibility  has not been on shoulders of priests and pastors only.  Brethren are the loyal priests.\r\n     Tithing is a hard topic to teach without spiritual understanding since we have  many high profile elite preachers teaching on the same with books written of great hoped promises and condemnation on the same for those who do not tithe, Ephesians 5:6-7, Thessalonians 2:3-4. Some  Christians in deceptive manner do teaching on tithes which is warmly appreciated from the pulpit. They become the magnetizing force with alluring great  hoped blessed promises of wealth .Pharisees and the Scribes were the most well educated and Jesus said woe unto them seven times for being  stumbling blocks in faith. Mathew 23:9-39.  We only need to rightly  divide  the  Word of God and  know whether we are Christians seeking salvation under the law or we are Christians saved by Christ through the Spiritual law of love  in grace, Corinthians 1:12-16,2 Timothy 2:15 .  We redeemed sons of God who are made Kings and priests unto God have a common inheritance in Christ Jesus, Galatians 4:4-5, Colssians1:9-14 ,1Corinthians 2:12-16. Revelation 1;4-6 . We are called spiritual sons of God after salvation and not before in fallen state. The same priests and pastors wreck the spiritual scriptures when they teach fallen Angles are called sons of God who married daughters of men giving offspring of giants , Genesis 6:1-8. God says he has never called any angles his son, Hebrew 1:4-5.When were fallen angles redeemed and sanctified  to be called sons? The ownership of increased daughters is unto men before being referred to as sons of God and the lust to polygamous marriage was with men. Are beautiful daughters born today for men? Shall we have another episode of fallen angles marrying daughters of men before the close of age? Many have taught the Word of God outside Biblical doctrines so many are deceived in their  teaching and preaching which condemn God as unjust  since no judgment is passed to angles they refer to as sons of God. When men dropped further from grace when they practiced polygamous marriage and their life span was reduced to one hundred and twenty years , no judgment is passed to purposed angles they teach us sons of God. The sons of God were men who had done reconciliation to God the same way Abel had done and was accepted by God. The judgment is specifically to mankind and giants born in sin of polygamous marriage do not qualify the sons of God to be angles. Angles are ministering spirits with no reproductive empowerment, Matthew 22:29-32, Hebrew 1:14-14. Our relationship to God our Father  is in  love in our loyal priesthood to the world. Roman 8:14-17. Only those who are covetous  mix  teaching under carnal law and spiritual teaching enlightenment under spiritual law .. The devil uses the nobles, evil and false witness to do his will according to circumstances, Acts 13;50-51 Acts 6: 9-14. Christians must remain wise and not be cheated by devils workers transforming themselves as angles of light. 2Corinthians11: 13-15. Levites Pastor, Priests and some Christians  misquote Jesus Christ on judgment.  Judge not that you may be not judged . Matthew7:1-5. They say God prohibit judgment which is not true since it is based on taking the scripture out of content and contest on understanding  Jesus statement. Shall you close your eyes to evils committed that they may not judge you. Do you buy yourself freedom from being judged for not condemning evil or commenting on anything positive or negative. The preaching of the Word of God is based on judgment on sins and righteousness . God requires from us  righteous judgment in wisdom and in love which condemn sins which leads man to repentant of sins and redemption. The  Word of God in its content and contest states judgment on sins and righteousness. All living beings and organic life are in  constant judgment for existent. If we can stop all processes of judgments life will come to a standstill and ultimate  death with final judgment of decay. Life and all creation were  established in good judgment by God and close of age shall end in judgment to eternal life or eternal death which is eternal life of suffering and separation from God. Genesis 1:1-31, Genesis 2:1-25. Even our bodies judge us out of energy and we hunger for food and thirst for water. All witty discoveries are results of acknowledgment of positive judgments on active well coordinated principals. Christians are encouraged to solve cases in judgment among themselves. 1Corinthians 6:1-7,The Bible encourage us that our love may abound yet more in knowledge and in all Judgment Philippians 1:9-12,.Life is in active constant judgments and the creation mourns for final judgment which it shall be subjected  by God. We relate in evaluation  to all things in judgment. Irrespective of any judgment delivered on us we should delivers the Heavenly Kingdom judgment to sins . We saved Christians are counted and judged worthy to suffer tribulations together with Christ when we live Christian life in love ,Revelation Chapter1,2and3.\r\n       There are may be those who preach tithing to saved Christians for lack of spiritual understanding. We should girdle up the loins of our minds. 1Peter :13-15.Roman 10:1-4. We shall not be  cornered and be cheated. God bless us in abundant grace of spiritual revelation and understanding of His Holy Word, Colssians1:9-14, Ephesians 5:6 -7,1Thessalonians 2:3-6, 2Timothy2:15, 2Timothy 2:24-26 . Amen\r\n       I am happy and blessed to interact with you on spiritual teachings. Hope we shall search more scriptures for our spiritual growth . Yearning  to receive  your input on the topic .God bless you.\r\nThe message is freely given\r\npurely to the body of JESUS CHRIST worldwide.",

There is still death and sickness and pain, and one day the Lord will remove those too. However, God did often protect his people from some of these problems or specifically curse their fields when they sinned. And he promised that those who obeyed his commands he would bless the work of their hands. This is what I'm referring to, not the total redemption of creation, but the daily blessing and provision of God. We are not under God's wrath, but his favor. It's also interesting to note (and I have been trying to find the source I heard this from) but there was a special viral plant that began to grow when God cursed the ground that would cover all the plants and make them difficult to cultivate. We no longer see this blight nowadays. It was what was meant by \"thorns and thistles.\" This is more specifically one of the curses given to the land that I believe God has removed.",

          "content:encoded": "<h1>God blesses Abraham</h1>\r\nGod greatly blessed Abraham in every way. He was with him, protected him, gave him long life in good health, abundant prosperity, victory over his enemies, and made him great before men (Genesis 12:1-3; 13:14-17; 15:1-21; and 17:1-27). These blessings were intended not to be given to Abraham alone, but to all of his descendants.\r\n<blockquote>Genesis 12:3 \"and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.\"\r\n\r\nGenesis 17:7 \"I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.\"</blockquote>\r\nThese blessings were transferred to his children Isaac (Genesis 26:1-5, 24) and Jacob (Genesis 28:13-15 and 35:9-12). There is no record of them ever having a sickness except for Jacob's weakness in his old age and there are plenty of verses showing how great their wealth and abundance was (Genesis 13:2, 26:12-16, etc). Even when Abraham lied, he was greatly blessed (Genesis 20). These blessings were not given on the basis of their law keeping, but on the basis of God's promise (Romans 4:13, Galatians 3:18, Hebrews 6:13).\r\n<h1>Who are Abraham's descendants?</h1>\r\nNow the blessings given to Abraham belonged not to his physical descendants, but instead to the descendants of the promise. Ishmael was a physical descendant, and he represents the covenant of the law, but he was not the child of promise. Isaac was the child of the promise. The promise was meant to be given by God's election through faith not by the effort or will of man. Ishmael could not receive the inheritance. He received a lesser blessing/curse, but it was not like the blessing of Isaac. Likewise, Jacob became the child of promise whereas Essau became the child of the flesh. Jacob received the inheritance whereas Essau received the lesser blessing/curse. Joseph's children received the best of the blessing whereas the rest of Jacob's sons received the lesser blessings/curse. Joseph's second born received the greatest blessing and the first born was given the lesser. Up until the law was given, they walked under the blessings of Abraham through faith. In the day the law was given, Israel spiritually fell from the promises by faith because the law nullified their faith. In fact, those who rely on the law are under a curse. They became like Ishmael, who received the lesser blessing/curse, and Essau, who forfeited his inheritance and received the lesser blessing/curse. Likewise the law established a blessing and great curse for those who were under it. If they could have kept the law, then they would have been blessed, but everyone is under the control of sin, so the inheritance could not be earned through the law. Therefore Christ came to fulfill the law and took the curse upon himself so that we would no longer be in bondage to it. He redeemed us from the law so that we might not be children of the flesh, but children of the promise and heirs of the promises made to Abraham. So the Israelites, the first-born or natural descent, were not the ones who received the ultimate promise, but rather it is the second-born, those with faith in Christ. Therefore anyone who believes in Christ, whether jew or gentile becomes a child of the promise and inherits everything promised to Abraham's heirs (Romans 9-11 and Galatians 2-4 and Deuteronomy 28 and Genesis 17:20).\r\n<h1>Abraham had two sons</h1>\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 4 \"<sup>21 </sup>Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? <sup>22 </sup>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. <sup>23 </sup>His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise.\r\n\r\n<sup>24 </sup>These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. <sup>25 </sup>Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. <sup>26 </sup>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. <sup>27 </sup>For it is written:\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n“Be glad, barren woman,\r\nyou who never bore a child;\r\nshout for joy and cry aloud,\r\nyou who were never in labor;\r\nbecause more are the children of the desolate woman\r\nthan of her who has a husband.”<sup>\r\n</sup>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<sup>28 </sup>Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are <strong>children of promise</strong>. <sup>29 </sup>At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. <sup>30 </sup>But what does Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote f\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%204&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-29162f\">f</a>]</sup><sup>31 </sup>Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.\"</blockquote>\r\nNow it comes to reason, if we are blessed with Abraham, what does this blessing include? In Galatians, is he talking only of righteousness and justification by faith apart from any material blessings? Or are the material blessings promised to Abraham and his descendants included in this inheritance? Let's look at some of these scriptures and see what impression we get.\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 3 \"<sup>7 </sup>Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham. <sup>8 </sup>Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”<sup>9 </sup>So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 3 \"<sup>13 </sup>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.”<sup>14 </sup>He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 4 \"<sup>16 </sup>Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who have the faith of Abraham.\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 6 \"<sup>13 </sup>When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,<sup>14 </sup>saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.”<sup>15 </sup>And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.\r\n\r\n<sup>16 </sup>People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.<sup>17 </sup>Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath. <sup>18 </sup>God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged. <sup>19 </sup>We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, <sup>20 </sup>where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 3 \"<sup>21 </sup>So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours, <sup>22 </sup>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+3%3A21-23&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-28433a\">a</a>]</sup> or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours,<sup>23 </sup>and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 4:13 \"<sup>13 </sup>It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 9:8 \"In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 9:30 \"That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; <sup>31 </sup>but the people of Israel, who pursued the law as the way of righteousness, have not attained their goal. <sup>32 </sup>Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 4:28 \"Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 3 \"<a href=\"http://bible.cc/galatians/3-16.htm\">16</a>The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,”<sup><a title=\"Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 24:7\" href=\"http://niv.scripturetext.com/galatians/3.htm#footnotes\">i</a></sup> meaning one person, who is Christ.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 3:29 \"If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 3:23 \"and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.\"\r\n\r\n2 Corinthians 1:20 \"For all of God's promises have been fulfilled in Christ with a resounding \"Yes!\" And through Christ, our \"Amen\" (which means \"Yes\") ascends to God for his glory.\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 9:12,15 \"12He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; <strong>but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood</strong>, having obtained eternal redemption … 15For this reason <strong>Christ</strong> is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may <strong>receive the promised eternal inheritance</strong>—now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.\r\n\r\n2 Peter 1:4 “Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust”.\r\n\r\nRomans 8:32 \"He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?\"\r\n\r\nJames 1:5 \"If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.\"\r\n\r\n1 Timothy 6:17 \"but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.\"\r\n\r\n1 Peter 3:9 \"not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead; for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing.\"\r\n\r\nEphesians 1:3 \"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.\"</blockquote>\r\n\"In the heavenly realms\" and \"spiritual blessing\" does not refer to the type of blessing it is, in the sense that one is intangible (spirit like) and the other is tangible (such as wealth or health) but it refers to \"how\" the blessing is given, not through works, but through the spirit.\r\n\r\nSo then what impression did you get? That God left out the material blessings and only transferred righteousness and justification by faith? And would there be fault in saying that even if the promises are summarized as justification by faith that it does not in some way include every other blessing? I mean if God justifies you by faith and calls you righteous, would he not also bless you materially as though you were righteous and justified in his sight? Did he not promise material blessings to the Israelites if they were righteous in his sight? If christians do not inherit Abraham's material blessings, then Abraham's covenant was better than Christ's! Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law so that the blessing of Abraham might come to everyone. What is the opposite of the curse? Justification? The opposite of the curse is a blessing and justification is the means by which we inherit that blessing.\r\n\r\nNow am I saying we need to live our lives to please our flesh? By no means. We don't set our pride on the treasures of this world which are so unstable. But rather we trust in God who richly provides us with all things for our enjoyment. I am not trying to make you materialistic, only hopeful and expectant of God's blessings, removing this doubtful idea that God cannot bless you practically. And if we learn to expect blessings from God, we can be content in our circumstances, knowing that God is in control and has authority to provide in earthly ways. I want us to escape this idea that God does not care about your earthly life, and he won't give you things that you ask him for because they are not spiritual enough or that God is waiting to bless you after you die. No, if God takes care of all the animals and they don't worry, why would he not take care of you who are of more value? Eternal life doesn't start till after we die, we have eternal life now. And I believe our inheritance doesn't start till after we die, it begins now. We need to learn to have a confident expectation of good from God in this life, while at the same time being content and patient with what we have.\r\n\r\nThe expression \"all spiritual blessings\" is indeed intended to be tangible such as wealth, health, protection, etc... in fact all the the blessings of Abraham are included. But the key difference is that they are given by faith through the spirit and not by the works of man (<a title=\"http://jaysnell.org/ASGPDF/Book1.pdf\" href=\"http://jaysnell.org/ASGPDF/Book1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://jaysnell.org/ASGPDF/Book1.pdf</a>). Of course, these blessings do also include \"spiritual\" blessings in the sense of peace, and wholeness, and life, and righteousness, and joy.\r\n\r\nConsider Barnes' Notes on the Bible.\r\n<blockquote>\"Are blessed with faithful Abraham - In the same manner they are interested in the promises made to him, and they will be treated as he was. They are justified in the same manner, and admitted to the same privileges on earth and in heaven\" (<a title=\"http://barnes.biblecommenter.com/galatians/3.htm\" href=\"http://barnes.biblecommenter.com/galatians/3.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://barnes.biblecommenter.com/galatians/3.htm</a>).\r\n\r\nWesley's Notes - 3:14 \"That the blessing of Abraham - The blessing promised to him. Might come on the gentiles - Also. That we - Who believe, whether Jews or gentiles. Might receive the promise of the Spirit - Which includes all the other promises. Through faith - Not by works; for faith looks wholly to the promise\" (<a title=\"http://wes.biblecommenter.com/galatians/3.htm\" href=\"http://wes.biblecommenter.com/galatians/3.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://wes.biblecommenter.com/galatians/3.htm</a>).\r\n\r\nGalatians 3:15 \"Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. <strong>Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant</strong> that has been duly established, so it is in this case. <sup>16 </sup>The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhatever promises God made to Abraham cannot be set aside. We who are in Christ are his seed so that the covenant to Abraham extends to us. This idea that the promise only refers to justification or righteousness by faith involves the separating of the covenant of Abraham. Justification and righteousness were a part of the promise, not the entirety. This covenant cannot be separated or set aside. When the scripture talks of the promise, it is referring to the whole of blessings and promises God made to Abraham.\r\n<blockquote>2 Corinthians 8:9 \"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.\"</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 3: \"<sup>5 </sup>So again I ask, does God <strong>give you his Spirit and work miracles among you</strong> by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? <sup>6 </sup>So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”</blockquote>\r\nWhen we are credited righteous through faith, God gives us his spirit and works miracles in our lives.\r\n<h1>What was the purpose of the law?</h1>\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 3 and 4 \"<sup>15 </sup>Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case. <sup>16 </sup>The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,”<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote i\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-29119i\">i</a>]</sup> meaning one person, who is Christ. <sup>17 </sup>What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise. <sup>18 </sup>For <strong>if the inheritance</strong> depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.\r\n\r\n<sup>19 </sup>Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator. <sup>20 </sup>A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one.\r\n\r\n<sup>21 </sup>Is the law, therefore, opposed to the <strong>promises of God</strong>? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.<sup>22 </sup>But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that <strong>what was promised</strong>, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.\r\n<h3>Children of God</h3>\r\n<sup>23 </sup>Before the coming of this faith,<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote j\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-29126j\">j</a>]</sup> we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. <sup>24 </sup>So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. <sup>25 </sup>Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.\r\n\r\n<sup>26 </sup>So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith,<sup>27 </sup>for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. <sup>28 </sup>There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <sup>29 </sup>If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and <strong>heirs according to the promise</strong>.\r\n\r\n4 What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.<sup>2 </sup>The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. <sup>3 </sup>So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote a\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-29135a\">a</a>]</sup> of the world. <sup>4 </sup>But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, <sup>5 </sup>to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote b\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-29137b\">b</a>]</sup><sup>6 </sup>Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, <i>“Abba</i>,<sup>[<a title=\"See footnote c\" href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+4&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-29138c\">c</a>]</sup> Father.” <sup>7 </sup>So you are no longer a slave, but God’s child; and since you are his child, God has made you also <strong>an heir</strong>.</blockquote>\r\nNotice that there is a parallel between Ishmael and the law. Now Abraham had received a promise that through Sarah (which represents grace / the new covenant) he would receive an heir. However, in his doubt with Sarah, he agreed to bear a child by Hagar so that God could fulfill his promises (Genesis 16). Now in the same way God had promised to bless all the earth through his \"seed,\" meaning Christ. However, in the meantime, Israel was subjected to law because of their own self-righteousness so that all men could see that their works could not deserve of God's promises. Thus Israel bore children according to Hagar and received the lesser blessing/curse. However, Abraham's ignorance did not stop the promise of God, just as Ishmael did not stop the blessing in Isaac.\r\n<h1>The blessing of health</h1>\r\nHealth is included in this blessing. After all, disease was a one of the curses in Deuteronomy 28, implying that the blessing was the opposite of that. However, Christ bore our sicknesses too in order to redeem us from under its curse.\r\n<blockquote>Isaiah 53:4 \"Surely he has borne our sickness, and carried our suffering\"\r\n\r\n3 John 1:2 \"Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhy could he pray for good health? Because Jesus bore our sicknesses so that we may enjoy a good long life.\r\n<blockquote>Genesis 15:15 \"As for yourself, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.\"</blockquote>\r\nThis promise was made to Abraham. This implies that there was no sickness to take away his peace. That even until his old age, it would be \"good.\"\r\n<h1>Every promise is yours</h1>\r\n<blockquote>Deuteronomy 27:14 \"The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice:<sup>15 </sup>“Cursed is anyone who makes an idol—a thing detestable to the Lord, the work of skilled hands—and sets it up in secret.”\r\n\r\nThen all the people shall say, “Amen!”\r\n\r\n<sup>16 </sup>“Cursed is anyone who dishonors their father or mother.”\r\n\r\nThen all the people shall say, “Amen!”\r\n\r\n<sup>17 </sup>“Cursed is anyone who moves their neighbor’s boundary stone.”\r\n\r\nThen all the people shall say, “Amen!”\r\n\r\netc...</blockquote>\r\nUnderstanding that under the old covenant the curses were spoken with an amen by the people, helps us to see the power of this verse in 2 Corinthians 1:20:\r\n<blockquote>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are \"Yes\" in Christ. And so through him the \"Amen\" is spoken by us to the glory of God.</blockquote>\r\nUnder the old, we spoke amen to the curses. Now in the new covenant we speak amen to God's promises. When the Israelites spoke amen to the curses, they were essentially saying, \"yes we agree that these things should come on us if we do these bad things.\" However, the new covenant believer is saying a different amen. An amen that says, \"yes, we agree that these promises should come upon us through Christ.\" This brings glory to God.\r\n<h1>So what does this mean?</h1>\r\nIsn't it wonderful that we have inherited such great and precious promises? These promises were not merely to be inward, spiritual promises or only promises for after you die. They include those things, but they also mean well being in this present life. However that leaves us to question, what about people who seem not to have those blessings. Before we begin to question people's experiences, let us designate what is our authority here. Do we make man's experience the authority on truth? Or do we make God's word the authority on truth? If you believe the bible teaches we are blessed with the blessings of Abraham, we must put that above any experiences we may have had. And if the bible does not teach that we are blessed that way, then we must attribute the blessings in our life to luck or chance.\r\n\r\nI want us to look at a conversation I had with the Lord. Again, I'm not guaranteeing that everything I heard was God, so I ask for your grace and discernment.\r\n<h1>Conversation with God</h1>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Grace contains so much more than just forgiveness for your sins. It was meant to pull you out of poverty and into abundance. Loosing sin consciousness is just the first step. I want you to begin exploring the benefits and blessings of grace so your expectations will change. Then you will be able to handle disappointment without being wasted and discouraged at every ill event in your life. If your hope is solid, your emotions will be fixed. The reason you are sad, is because you are poor at handling disappointment. And you cannot recover when you get disappointed because you have no good expectation to look forward to. Jon Paul, my grace will teach you life skills and make you good at everything. If you want to have my peace, listen to what I teach. I know some are eager to pull you to their cause and make you slaves of disappointment, striving for what is not yours. But I have called you holy and separate, and a holy people must not mix with illegitimate children. The children of the law, must be separated from the children of grace, and there will be a distinguishing.”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Lord in the Old Testament, the children of the promise were separated from the children of the law just as you have described.

And many Christians do not expect, seek, or ask of me for anything beyond what their deeds deserve because they are ashamed of the message you carry. They are fearful of what a message of blessing might do. Some have in fact turned the message upside down, preaching against the message of prosperity and using it as a weapon in instructing in righteousness. They take advantage of the weak, and cause many to become bitter and forfeit their inheritance. Know that I am not taking about your heavenly inheritance, but that of this life and the enjoyment of the riches of God in your day to day life. Experience is not always the way to test God's will. In fact a renewed mind means you have to unlearn your experiences sometimes to find God's will. This is what I will be talking to you about. God's will to bless you.

Lot was captured, his wife was taken from him, and later the Israelites were slaves in Egypt for 400 years. But nevertheless God used each of those situations to bless them. Lot was rescued with great plunder, Abraham's wife was restored with the wealth of Egypt, and the Israelites were saved and brought with them all the plunder of Egypt. Like the early church, they endured for a while and then God turned the tables and greatly blessed them through their trouble. The early Jews used to have a mindset that if a man was poor or sick or troubled, then it was a sign of the Lord's rejection. That's why they would say things like, \"Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?\" It is also why the author of Hebrews had to tell them of the Lord's discipline. He was saying that hardships are not a sign of God's rejection, they are a sign that assures you are truly God's children, because God's children will undergo persecution. God's blessing does not make light of suffering. His blessing is victorious in the midst of trials and problems. For God's power is made perfect in weakness (2 Corinthians 12:9). So when you have troubles, God's blessing is there to rescue you and turn the situation around for your good. So when you find poverty, lack, persecution, trouble, or hardships in your life, do not feel ashamed, doubt God's character, or worry about your lack of faith. Simply believe with patience and eagerly hope for God to turn the situation around for your blessing. God's will to bless you is not thwarted in hardship, it is amplified. In fact, whenever you have a hard time, you can joyously expect God to show up because He is attracted to your problems. This is why Paul rejoices in his sufferings. For God's power shows up and delivers him out of them all. Like this ship in the storm, they were subjected to hardship, yet the Lord rescued all of them in the end.",

But I remember a vision of Joseph Prince in which he saw pipes flowing which were blocked when the Christian started fearing or worrying. If so, can we somehow \"reject\" our blessings by fear and worry? That seems to contradict the blessings of those received from imperfect faith. But then again I'm not sure because imperfect faith does not necessarily lead to worry or fear. I've been thinking about whether blessings could be \"rejected\" by our will as Joseph Prince's vision implies. This doesn't seem fair to me. Why can't the evil ever will away their curses if it is true that the righteous may impede their blessing through fear? I walked on the field and talked to God about it and emotionally I sensed he said not to worry about Joseph Prince.",

              "wp:comment_content": "You saw angels too? What did they look like? Did they have wings? A flashy face? Nice robes?\r\n\r\nHmm that was a good message, although I am curious about some parts. If the apostles receive honor for every new Christian, would it be a fair reward system? The exponentially multiplying honor would probably greatly exceed every righteous man in the Old Testament combined at this rate. How would it be fair that for Job, Daniel and others that their reward is weighed when they die, but for the 12 apostles the reward never stops flowing? It has been accumulating for two melleniums.  Also puzzling is the fact that many martyrs exist in modern days who have done the same as the apostles and yet would receive much less, because the number of people converted by them \"by domino effect\" would necessarily be less than the apostles, and far less. I wonder why God would work this way. If it works that way it would mean that every preacher who has gone before gets greater rewards than those who have came afterwards because of the difference in converts by association. I thought it was not the total number of ultimately attributed converts that could be connected to 1 martyr that counts, but the effort each person gave alone. Did not God praise the woman who gave the last coin more than the rich man who gave a block of gold? If God judges by a strict rule of \"the ones who caused this chain of conversion to start gets more\", then what about the billionaires? In theory they could then fund 10 missionaries and reap the reward for all their labour. Or if God judges by who started the first conversions, why not give Abraham more than the 12 apostles combined? After all the apostle Paul said all Christians were Abraham's seed. God credited the coming of Christ to Abraham's sacrifice. \r\n\r\n\" see the saints who gave up their blessings in this life for a greater reward. And through their sacrifice, they inherited that reward. They wanted people to come to the Lord and be saved. And their martyr-ship and diligence caused many to persevere so that now they are reaping their reward by bringing hundreds in.\"\r\n\r\nBrother JonPaul, I am also curious about God's thoughts on martyrdom and bringing converts. See the former quote. I am not sure whether God's reward rests on \"bringing hundreds in\" or \"martyr-ship\" or \"diligence\". For one, I could be a billionaire and fund a hundred missionaries who each converted 10 people. Can I get the reward for the 1000 converts without becoming poor? Or else I could be super rich and still be personally preaching in dangerous nations and getting myself killed, which would make me a martyr. Does the \"greater reward\" still belong to me? Or again, I could be diligent and personally go preaching while not being martyred and still having great wealth. \r\n\r\nI also wonder what Paul meant when he \"wanted faith to be genuine\". To me I think asking for money is better strategically. If you make your ministry rich, it will not repel those who truly believe in Christ, but it will also convert greedy people who want money, because they will see that Christ can make people rich. Wouldn't this make a total of more converts than just converting the people who aren't interested in money? Why does money test genuine faith while healing, health and discipline are not looked upon as contradictory to the true preaching of the gospel? Healing and health are also material benefits. And about those Christians who ask God for academic grades or discipline...they seem oh-so-righteous but really, they aren't asking for the type of discipline that will make them get up at 6 and preach till 10. They're only asking for discipline to do well in their jobs and academics...which again, is either targeted toward their desire for fame or money. I can't comprehend why asking for knowledge, health and healing would not rob us of that \"greater reward\" but asking for money would. God mentioned martyrdom, but what of the beggars he also mentioned? Why should they receive a greater reward than a richer man like me? The beggars don't preach over-time do much better than us. They just put their bum on the concrete and do no extra good deeds at all. Why should they be given the greater reward just because they are poor? I don't get why the poor missionaries should receive the greater reward over those that aren't poor either. Sure, it displays a nice spirit of diligence if you're poor and preaching-it requires more effort. But so does preaching when you have sickness. Why doesn't Jesus give the sick preachers more credit than the ones who can walk many kilometres comfortably every day as if they've just taken a few steps?\r\n\r\nThere is also the problem that this \"greater reward\" contradicts your other post about the sowing and reaping that says all good things in heaven are shared and rewards are mostly personal instead of competitive. If it is indeed true that the poor gets greater reward in heaven, then by definition it means that well off people like us gets the lesser reward. Brother I don't know if I want to ask God for a sum of money only to have a pile of gold taken away from me in heaven. \r\n\r\nI too thought about \"the poor will inherit the earth\". But I thought it was in the context of God saying that he will make them rich. I didn't see how it could fit that he meant it to mean \"the poor will receive more than the pure, the meek, the peaceful, the ones who thirst for righteousness...and the rest of us that are described in that paragraph\". The context seems like God blessing all kinds of people who display different types of perserverance and righteousness. It didn't seem like he was saying the poor will receive a greater blessing than the rest of us.",

          "content:encoded": "I invited John Long from <a title=\"http://siggit81.wordpress.com/\" href=\"http://siggit81.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Souring in Grace / Grounded in Truth</a> to speak on my blog about grace. He is an insightful man who follows the Holy Spirit and a good friend. I am privileged to know someone so wonderful who is helping to pioneer the movement of grace.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color:#000000;\">Jon Paul in black</span>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">John Long in orange</span></p>\r\n<b><b> </b></b>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Greetings John Long! I’m so glad I get the chance to hear the life changing message you carry. I really appreciate you taking the time to address this interview and show me and my readers your heart in the message of grace.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Well I have a list of questions I want to ask you, perhaps we’ll have time to address a few, but either way, I’m sure it will be fruitful!</span></p>\r\n<span style=\"color:#000000;\">I see a lot of people talking about the message of grace or the grace movement. What exactly does this mean? Why do they call it a grace movement? Why do we call the message of grace the gospel?</span><b><b> </b></b>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">You know Jon, I think many people, including myself, have found that God has been pointing them towards a deeper understanding of grace and as they start to follow this revelation, they find themselves in the midst of this thing that many are calling a movement. But they never went to a meeting or bought a book on how to go deeper into grace. They may have even thought, as I did, that they already knew about grace and needed to mature into the “deeper” things.  But then they start to see that others are catching this as well and that rather than being part of some big new flashy looking thing, they realize that their whole understanding of the gospel has radically been changed. So yes, you could say it is a movement because it is moving in people’s lives, but I think a better word is reformation because people’s foundations and perceptions are being reformed rather than having something new added to what they already have.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">So why do we call the gospel grace? Well to start, in John’s gospel, it begins by making the point that whereas Law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ and that this was God’s revelation of Himself to the Earth (the law failed to reveal God’s heart for us). Combine that with the beginning of Luke’s gospel, where the angels proclaimed that this Savior being born would be good news to all people. That equals the gospel. It is the revelation that God is good and shows that goodness in the form of grace at His own expense. He gave to us what we could never give to Him according to the Law’s demands. One of the best definitions I have heard of grace came from Watchman Nee, who simply said that law is when something is demanded from us but grace is where God gives something to us.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Thank you John. I like how you said that God has been pointing us to a deeper understanding of grace. I too have found that to be true. Most of what I learned about grace was by the Lord, if I dare say. When He would speak to me, He would teach me grace. It was shocking for me at first, but then I started finding others who had encountered the Lord in the same way. What was it like for you when you first began to embrace the message of grace? Tell us your your background and what happened so that now you are writing articles on this message?</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">Well its funny Jon, but I have been writing posts on my blog: Soaring In Grace / Grounded In Truth, for about 4 years. But I don’t consider myself to have truly embraced pure grace until about 2 years ago even though I had a powerful encounter with the Father’s love that changed me back in 2000. I was even known by some to be a “grace guy” and always held that God was incredibly good. But there was this mixture that I had been caught up in that would say, “yes we are under grace but...” So what I and many others had was this sense of having to put the brakes on when it “too much” emphasis was placed on grace. It wasn’t that I “liked” to believe that way or considered myself very legalistic, but I did not have the clear understanding of truth necessary to break free.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">At the time, the teachers and influences in my life had mostly been from the whole charismatic/prophetic circle, which I still greatly appreciate. But I came to realize that even though this branch of the Body of Christ was very open to God and had wonderful encounters with God, there was not a clear distinction made between Old and New Covenant. Things became very blurry when it came to where the line was. One day you are basking in love and grace and the next trying to avoid the curses of Deutoronomy through rigid obedience.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">The way that this mixture became apparent to me all started one night when I was looking for something to watch on Youtube. I came across a video called “Grace and Truth Revival” by Revival or Riots ministries out of California. As I listened to the message, it was very different than the types of teachings I had been accustomed to. There was such a clear revelation of the gospel being presented. Things like our forgiveness for past, present, and future (all) sins and our righteousness apart from what we do were boldly proclaimed rather than a flaky “well, we are forgiven and righteous but we still have to do x,y, and z or else that goes away maybe” kind of gospel.  I felt a stirring inside similar to what I had experienced when I first was born again. Little did I know that this was the beginning of something huge.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">Within the next 2 days, I heard about Joseph Prince from 3 totally unrelated sources. Over the next few months I ended up hearing about all kinds of preachers from all across the world and church who had this fresh experience with grace that I was having. It was amazing. Like you Jon, I would read something in the Bible or hear it in prayer and then hear a message about it the very next day. And yes, some of these things were shocking and challenging, but thankfully God helped me to embrace these new realities that were bringing such freedom to my life and accept that the preachers I had so looked up to might not have had it all right doctrinally.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">Before long I realized: “hey something has happened to me”. I would go to listen to an old message that I would have really been into in years past and could no longer relate (because of the lack of grace). But that’s not all that was different. Bondages of fear, bitterness, and disappointment just seem to effortlessly fall of as I soaked in this fresh gospel revelation without me even praying or confessing or barfing up devils. No wonder it is referred to as “the power of God unto salvation.” (Rom.1:16)</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wonderful John. So you wouldn’t describe yourself as anti-grace or without grace before but it simply hadn’t been emphasized or “purified,” if that’s the correct term, in your mind. This is the way I think many people I know look at it. It’s like they don’t deny grace in word, but in practice they live as though it wasn't practical. Because just like you said, in their attempts to “balance” the bible, they contradict themselves in their beliefs between works and faith, judgment and favor, wrath and peace. And somehow in a strange way we seem to make sense of it and end up with this up and down rollercoaster christianity. “I’m was ok with God yesterday, but now today I am not. Yesterday He was pleased with me and giving his favor, but today He has backed away to teach me to grow closer.” Christians describe themselves as going through seasons of dryness, testing, and the Lord’s absence, and then later describe seasons of God’s favor, goodness, and His presence. At least that’s just how it was for me for years. It seems the message of grace has a subtle difference, but its enough difference to be called by its own name and to turn all of that around. What is this message of grace? I’m sure people are not sure all of what we mean when we are talking about it. Some even are afraid that the message of grace is deceptive or dangerous. Does it deserve these titles that we give it such as “hyper-grace, anti-works, a license to sin, elementary teaching, avoiding real scriptures, or forgetting about good works?”</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">Well said Jon Paul. So let me break down what I mean when I say the message of grace. Its very simple actually. I am really just referring to the gospel: Jesus Christ and the finished work that He accomplished on behalf of mankind. In the 1st chapter of the book of John, in verses 14 -18, we see that the eternal Word of God became flesh. It says that He revealed the glory of the Father in that He was full of grace and truth. It then goes on to clarify that Law was given through Moses but that grace and truth came through Jesus. I find it interesting that in this passage it says that God revealed Himself through grace and truth rather than through law. His heart was revealed through the Son, not the stones. Although the law does reveal our need for Him, it does not say that we should balance law and grace in order to come to the final revelation of God. To further clarify this, Hebrews starts off by making it clear that even though God revealed Himself to the Old Testament saints in various ways, He is now speaking to us in the person of Christ (see Heb. 1:1-3). He did not just bring a revelation of God, but IS the revelation of God. So the gospel goes beyond a message of how we can be saved, but is a revelation of the heart of God to mankind. So at the end of the Old Testament, which gives the story of man’s sin, the law, and the temporary judgements of God, there might be some confusion about what the nature of God is like. The gospel is the clear look into the heart of God. And rather than being a philosophical or esoteric concept, this love was revealed through the climactic act of Christ’s sacrifice.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">So to comment on what you said about the up and down Christianity you experienced: I think that people really need to grasp the gospel message. Paul said to the Colossians that the gospel was bearing fruit in their lives ever since they “heard and understood the grace of God in truth (see Col. 1:6).” But since we have mostly been taught a watered down gospel that lack the fullness of the truth of grace, we look for something else to fill the void in our hearts and to become fruitful, whether it be the latest revival meetings, a future “season” of blessing that we wait for, or the newest Christian sub-culture trend. But Christ is said to be the fulfillment, the substance of all of the good things God has for us. He is our Sabbath, our Life (revival), and our Year of never ending favor. By the way, Paul rebuked the Colossians for observing Sabbaths and seasons in Chapter 2.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">Now to address the “dangers” of grace that are popping up all around. You know Jon, this is something I’ve given much thought and prayer. I’m well aware of how this fresh grace revelation is being blacklisted as “hyper grace” and “greasy grace” and such. I think this is all basically rooted in a misunderstanding of grace and scripture in general. You also touched on something that I have heard quite a bit that says, “yes there are scriptures on grace but you have to read the whole Bible with the wrath and judgments and all.” The funny thing is, this is exactly what I would say to the ones warning against too much grace. Yes there is law and judgement in scripture, but if you read the whole book you end up in the key of grace. Take 2 Corinthians 3 for example. Paul says that the glory of the law was destined to fade away but that the New Covenant has a glory that will ever increase. The whole point of the law and evil being allowed to run its course was to bring us to a revelation of the mercy and grace of our Father. To call grace dangerous in my opinion is to call the gospel dangerous. The only way humanity will be saved and transformed is through the preaching of the gospel (grace). There is no “ok that doesn’t work so let’s beat people into submission with the law” plan B.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">Something that people will say about the gospel is that a true gospel is one of repentance and holiness being proclaimed. I think people take repentance out of context and also misconstrue the definition. It means to change your thinking and though Jesus did say “Repent or perish”, this was something He said to those under the law to show how all mankind needs a Savior (see Luke 13). But I see T-shirts and banners with this one-liner, which in my opinion puts the gospel in a false light. A New Covenant verse to take into consideration  says that it is the goodness of God that leads us to repentance (see Rom 2:4). But we preach it backwards. We say, “repent or else you won’t see the goodness of God”. Furthermore, we are to repent from dead works, Hebrews says. This means I repent from trying to work for my salvation and spiritual success and trust the Living God instead. Not to mention that originally Jesus was telling Jews to repent about how they viewed the Kingdom of God (when it would come and how it would look) not their sin (see Matt. 1:17 &amp; Mark 1:15). So you see how these things can get blown out of proportion.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">When Paul was correcting the Galatian church, he said he was shocked that they were turning from the grace of God to another gospel. Did you see that? Grace = the gospel! So I think the heresy hunters are aiming their guns at the wrong culprit when they warn about grace, even though I am sure some people have perverted the idea of grace just like they could with anything else in the Bible. You don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">And yes, holiness in terms of the way we live out the gospel is important, but Romans 6:22 says that this is the fruit of the gospel, not the message or the root. I don’t walk up to a sinner and say, “I have good news for you: you must be as holy as God.” Grace is the message because Jesus is the message and He just so happened to reveal grace and truth, not a God who was out for revenge and forced obedience. Just like we reject the idea of a “prosperity” gospel which says Jesus just came to make us successful, why do we not also reject the idea of a holiness gospel or a repentance gospel when Paul said that there can be none other than the gospel of grace.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">What you’re talking about reminds me of Galatians 3:24-25 “So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.” So what you’re saying is that because people are only hearing a watered down version of grace mixed with the law, they are not seeing its effects in their life and instead find themselves in “seasons” of dryness or abundance instead of the year of unceasing favor. That was my experience. I had been in a church that taught grace along with concepts of law/judgment/conditionality and when I heard the pure gospel of grace it was as if I was hearing it for the first time; as if I had not ever heard it before. It made a noticable impact of everything in my life. It seems this message of grace will inevitably change some of our closely held philosophies or at least cause us to question them.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">When you speak of repentance, you do not mean the confession of sin and beating yourself physically or emotionally, you mean changing our opinions and thoughts on a matter. Usually when I find repentance mentioned in the Bible, it’s used toward people who don’t believe the gospel that they must turn from their self-righteousness towards justification by faith in Christ. However, Hebrews mentions repentance in context of repenting of dead works, which we understand to be “useless rituals.” Those rituals that were required by the old covenant to purify the sins of the people. I believe its only once used to refer to sin in Corinthians. So now, I have two questions for you. What do you do when you find a scripture that seems to contradict the grace message? And what are some of the ways that the gospel can be mistaught or confused? Are there any warnings or comments that you would give people who are just now hearing about grace?</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">Well, to answer the first question: the Lord gave me a message a little while ago called “Keep Reading Until You Get To Grace”. What it basically says is that the whole story of the Bible culminates with the grace of Christ being revealed so we should be able to see how each scripture has its fulfillment in Jesus and His work on the cross. I’m not saying that we should only read scriptures that sound gracious to the naked ear, but that we can be assured of the grace of the Lord Jesus throughout all of Scripture. As you just mentioned, the law was our schoolmaster to lead us to Christ. Law was fulfilled in grace, not the other way around. Along with Law came the devastating consequences of disobedience. But this was all to show man his need for a Savior. When grace is emphasized, the blessings that follow are also emphasized rather than judgments for those who fail to keep the law.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">To expand on that just a little, there are still warning and judgement scriptures which addresses what happens when we reject Jesus and His gospel. However, I would not say that these contradict the grace message. Think of someone who constantly rejects love and is cold to people who reach out to them. This person’s actions do nothing to lessen the power of love, but their actions are preventing them from experiencing the power of love. In the same way, grace is truth, but for those who reject it, this truth will not be their experience.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">I think the gospel/grace is mistaught or confused when we remove the cross from the message. Paul said we preach Christ and Him crucified, not Christ and Him laying in a manger or Him coming back on a white horse. So what I have seen is that there are two ways in which the cross gets removed from our message. The first way is easily recognized. This is where people just preach that God loves us and accepts us (which is 100% true) but mention nothing about salvation through the cross. The church then becomes a nice charitable organization but without any power. In this kind of church, there is a fear of offending man and unity is sought after, but again, in a way that tries to bypass the cross. They will say, well we are all good people (which we can all be good people by having His nature birthed in us). They may also say, well we are all just sinners, God understands and has pity on us. Again, this is true apart from the cross; but that is why He died; to kill that old man that was contrary to our original design. So you see, all of these things are devoid of the cross. His cross is where God’s love was manifested and where we lose our sin nature and take on righteousness instead. The old acronym says GRACE is God’s riches AT CHRIST’S EXPENSE, not merely God’s riches.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">But there is another side to this crossless gospel. But this one is more readily accepted by religious zealots. This is where our own obedience and discipline is emphasized over what Christ did on our behalf. In this gospel you hear things like, “Gotta die to self and crucify the flesh everyday brother.” “Gotta obey in order to see the blessings.” Now these things seem very spiritual and even pro-cross, but you see our cross, our sacrifice is not what saves us. His cross did! I find that people in this group can be very harsh and critical. It is because they are actually trying to keep the law and know that they are failing deep down. So they judge others they deem less spiritual than themselves. They counter that with even more self-discipline and effort to please God. I have been bit by this thing myself. They preach “we will do whatever God says”. This sounds great on the surface, but is that not what got  Israel in trouble in the wilderness? They said “Whatever you command us, that we will do.” Then the law and judgements started coming and they fell short of their promise over and over without simply confessing their need for grace like king David. You’re much better off accepting Christ and His sacrifice and saying something like this: “I could never believe and obey God perfectly. This is why I need a Savior. By grace, I have been crucified with Christ and  it is no longer I that live but Christ lives in me. Through His life, His faith, and His obedience, I will enjoy and manifest the good life in God.” So the cross is not all about us trying to die to self, even though self-sacrifice is woven into the nature of the Christian, but accepting the great exchange of His life for ours. The cross is supernatural, it is where we were mystically united with God.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">As far as warnings to those hearing grace, I would say not to fear excess of grace, which will send you cowering back into law. But I would also say to let the Holy Spirit teach you about grace and expand your current revelation. Get this for yourself and don’t try to copy someone else. I would also say that this message comes with persecution. People may not stone you with stones here in the West, but they may stone you with words. But always run what people say through the Scripture and the fruit of the Spirit and you will not go wrong. If you are trying to control grace or balance grace, you won’t experience the true freedom that comes from grace according to God. If you are afraid of getting into error, you already are in error because fear is error. But the love and grace of the Father will set you free from these fears.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">I would also add that grace will set you free from bad habits but it usually brings them to the surface first. This is because when grace is present, we quit hiding under a religious mask. We might think that we have been really holy trying to keep a religious form or law, but many times we are actually suppressing these negative things inside whereas grace will deal with them in love. You will lose your false humility that tries to make itself look spiritual as you realize that all goodness comes from Him. You lose the fear of being rejected by God under grace but you also lose the desire for sin. So I like to say that Grace is God’s all purpose solution for life on Earth. What is this grace? It is not a spiritual energy drink to help us perform better, it is not God ignoring our sin. It is the gift of Christ Himself living in us.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Wow! Excellent John. In my own study, I have purposefully examined scriptures that seem to contradict grace because I have the same conviction as you, that eventually we will find grace in them because that’s the core of the gospel. It also seems we’ve taken some of the scriptures of judgement (written to unbelievers) and applied them to believers and condemned ourselves. I might need to look again at the bible and see if there are scriptures where I do that.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">I can also understand the crossless gospel preached. In some sermons I listen to, I never even hear Christ mentioned nor any concepts of what he did. However, they also speak on things that are trivial or contradictory to the message of the cross and claim that those things are the messages of true importance. And its not that obedience and good deeds shouldn’t be taught, but we have to remember their context. Genuine love is not our love for God, it is God’s love for us. When we lose sight of that, emphasizing our love, our good deeds, our obedience rather than or in replacement of God’s, we don’t see God’s love. And if we don’t see God’s love, our good deeds or love become like a shadow of true fruit. Good fruit comes when we are drinking in good resources. It’s amazing how ministries like Joseph Prince will emphasize Christ and secondary to that obedience and yet the people in their church are being set free from some of the most difficult addictions whereas other churches emphasize obedience and disregard the cross (unintentionally) and yet see people struggle with many problems. No church is without problems, but it seems when grace is preached, people become truly willing and eager to do good out of gratefulness rather than reluctance, self-discipline, and fear.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Thank you for those warnings. I think the fear ministers have is that if they preach grace, their members will want to live sinful lifestyles. But just like you said, we all are surprised to find that sin un-becomes us when our hearts are overflowing with gratitude. Obedience should still be taught but only secondary to grace and not in replacement of it. And you’re right, we can never preach too much grace. It seems the more gracious it is, the better the fruit is. The danger is when we stop preaching grace and still expect gratefulness. That’s when we start to see unintentional fruits such as judgmentalism, harshness, criticalness, rudeness, inner strife, rebellion, and people falling away. Grace is what makes people loyal to God. When they forget about grace and put their trust in how good they’ve been they will eventually realize that they still mess up. And every time their trust will be shattered. So they come to realize their trust is unstable and they will sometimes chose to walk away from the faith because of that. I have many friends who started walking away from the faith because they were burnt out of their religious backgrounds but then the message of grace took hold of them and now today they are the most dedicated christians.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">You said, “<span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">grace will set you free from bad habits but it usually brings them to the surface first</span>.” This is somewhat what happened to me when I came to grace. Unfortunately when you live under a religious system, though outwardly you are doing all the right things, inwardly you struggle with yourself. You find yourself ambitious to do good works outwardly, but inwardly your heart regrets it and finds no pleasure in it. You think it does, you try to make yourself want what is good, but secretly you entertain wishes for sinful freedom. When grace is not well taught (taught without Christ), sometimes that rebellion that has been harboring in people’s hearts will use that message as an excuse to entertain sinful lusts. However people who think that way have completely missed the message of grace. Grace does not make sin ok, it makes you righteous despite your sin. And when you are righteousness always, you exhibit your identity in your behaviors. Its actually a promise of genuine change. So people who rebel that way eventually realize that there is no reward to their sin, and in humility they truly accept the grace of God. Their very rebellion becomes the catalyst by which they are truly bound to grace. Meaning, it becomes the avenue by which God forgives them and makes them truly grateful. Then they find their behaviors not merely outwardly doing what is right, but from deep within they find a great joy and eagerness to do what is right from their heart. Their heart doesn’t betray them when they do good. No one has to convince them of the good they need to do, they find it coming naturally.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Thank you so much John for your time. This has been a wonderful introduction to the controversy of grace. I really enjoy your thoughts and the revelation that the Spirit gives you. I pray that our readers will be blessed and know deep within that they are loved. I pray that God’s grace would be accepted in them and that they would be truly grateful. John, it’s been a blessing having you. Hopefully we will do another interview soon. Do you have any closing thoughts?</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">Thanks Jon Paul. It’s been a pleasure. Well, to  close I would just encourage and bless everyone in the same way that the early church fathers did; which is to grow in the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and see it multiplied in your lives. Don’t back off of your pursuit of the genuine gospel message. If your gospel doesn’t sound too good to be true, well then it probably is not the gospel. This fresh grace revelation, call it a movement or whatever, is not some passing trend in the church that will fade away or be replaced in a few years.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"color:#ff9900;\">Over the past few decades, the church has gone through times of focusing heavily on such topics as faith, spiritual warfare, the prophetic, etc. These have all been beneficial in their own way and had been neglected by much of the church. But grace is different. It is not merely a doctrine or principle amongst many others, but is the essence of the gospel. So with this movement, we are actually simply returning to the true message and seeing Jesus for who He really is. I’m going to be bold and say that the whole message of the Bible is Jesus Christ and His finished work. We must see the whole before we can understand each part. We have compartmentalized the Bible over here in the West into many separate topics that are supposed to help us live successful spiritual lives, but if we miss the simplicity of Christ, what have we really gained? Jesus is the answer. Simple enough for you? It is my desire to see people filled with the knowledge of the glory of God, which is Jesus and the grace that He brought to mankind.</span></p>",

          "content:encoded": "If you've been keeping up with my blog, then you will recognize that I often share conversations I had with the Lord. I didn't always hear God the way I do now. At one time, I was lucky to hear him give me a single sentence. Sometimes I would go months without hearing his voice. That changed a few years ago when I started to believe that God wanted to speak to me all the time and that I could hear his voice. As I prayed, God began to teach me how easy it was to hear his voice and how I could hear him all the time. I know there are many other people who might not have been privileged to learn these things, so I want to share a conversation I had with the Lord about how to hear him. Hearing God's voice is not vital to your christian walk. You can be a dedicated christian and never hear God's voice. You hear him for your sake, not his. There is no penalty for not hearing his voice and it does not make you any less of a person. Everyone can learn to hear God's voice, God does not show favoritism. I hope these words jump start you into a relationship of communication with God. I pray for all my readers, that they would begin to hear God's voice clearly and hear him speaking in their own language all the time.\r\n\r\nI don't hear everything perfectly. Take what settles well with your spirit and reject things that aren't beneficial. I just ask for your grace for me to sometimes hear my Lord incorrectly as I try to accurately convey him.\r\n<h1>How do I hear God's voice?</h1>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I've felt dry lately.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">You can always come to me when you feel dry.”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Wow.

In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us.” So this is saying that the spirit tells us the thoughts of God. And I know my own thoughts because of my spirit within me. So if my spirit knows my thoughts, then your spirit in me would know your thoughts, and I would recognize those thoughts by the spirit?

It is the spirit in you that teaches you the sound of my voice and teaches you my words and wisdom.”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Lord, it seems to me like there are many people with the spirit who consider speaking with God foolishness.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Your mind needs to be renewed.

People don't hear me when I speak in a way they don't expect. They did not recognize who I was because they had made conclusions about how I would come and why. Sometimes when you hear God's voice you have to unlearn those expectations so you can recognize God the way he speaks. For instance, one notion is that God only speaks through the Bible. The Bible is a record of my promises, but it takes the spirit of revelation to interpret it. Some people think I speak through events. So when events are going poorly, they think I am trying to tell them something. Their preconceived notions are hindering them from experiencing the full potential of the way God wants to speak to them.”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">How do you want to speak to them?</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">I want them to recognize my spirit and to be able to tell when my spirit is giving them words. For some that will look like visions or dreams. Others will get impressions, intuitions, senses, or feelings of things they should do or say. Some like you will hear my words in their heart so that they can write down what I am saying. These are all ways the spirit manifests and he does so to each person as that person learns to listen in that area. After all, would I give a picture of a turtle to a man who has not been trained to interpret visions? Would he not consider it foolishness?

It is full of wisdom and mercy and you will hear love in every sentence. It keeps no record of wrongs. It is satisfying and easy to listen to. It will be full of life and joy. James 3:17 'But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.' God is a gracious God and he does not show favoritism. He will not speak to you because you are rich, because you have more intelligence or good deeds than another person. He delights in all alike and he reveals his wisdom to everyone with his spirit. The only thing that will keep you from hearing is your own earthly judgements and self-made limitations.”</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Wow, so we really need to learn how to get rid of those limitations.</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p align=\"LEFT\"><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Like that God will only speak to man in a certain way or under certain conditions.

          "content:encoded": "I want to talk about a passage that can be difficult to understand in terms of God's grace in Galatians 6.\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 6 \"7 Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. 8 Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. 9 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.10 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.\"</blockquote>\r\nI want to share two perspectives on this verse, which might together be one perspective. But that involves talking some about the context and then talking about the word flesh.\r\n\r\nThroughout Galatians (I would recommend reading the book from beginning to end), he is reprimanding these pious jews for trying to make the Gentiles like them. By \"like them\" I mean that the jews were trying to establish a righteousness or \"covenant membership\" through keeping the law. Thus they wanted the gentiles to be circumcised, keep the whole law, follow the jewish customs and enter into God's kingdom through those means. The same problem we saw in Acts.\r\n<blockquote>Acts 15:1 \"Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.”\r\n\r\nRomans 10:3 \"Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.\"</blockquote>\r\nPaul tells these gentiles,\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 1:6 \"I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—7 which is really no gospel at all.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 1:10 \"Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to <strong>please</strong> people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 2:4 \"This matter arose because some false believers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves. 5 We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 2 \"14 When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs? 15 “We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles 16 know that a person is not <strong>justified by the works of the law</strong>, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 3 \"1 You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. 2 I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard? 3 Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by <strong>means of the flesh</strong>?\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 3 \"10 For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: 'Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.'\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 3 \"23 Before the coming of this faith, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. 24 So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. 25 Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. 26 <strong>So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith</strong>, 27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 4 \"17 Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, s<strong>o that you may have zeal for them</strong>. 18 It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 5:3 \"3 Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. 4 You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. 5 For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope. 6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe primary issue that Paul was facing was with the jewish customs according to the law, but Paul refers to a greater principle, that those things are of human tradition and law and no one remains a christian through keeping the law or traditions. So circumcision becomes the \"face\" of righteousness through works. Now we know that when Paul speaks of the law, he is not merely referring to the ceremonial law but the entire law.\r\n<blockquote>2 Corinthians 3:7 \"But if the ministration of death, <strong>written and engraved in stones</strong>, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:\"</blockquote>\r\nThe ceremonial law was never written and engraved on stones, the ten commandments were.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 7:7 \"Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, \"Do not covet.\"</blockquote>\r\nIt was the ten commandments that said \"Do no covet.\"\r\n<blockquote>Romans 6:15 \"What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no means!\"</blockquote>\r\nThese believers were wrongly getting the idea that sin was now ok since we are no longer under law. Why would they have had that impression if they thought Paul only meant the ceremonial law?\r\n\r\nAnd finally in Galatians itself,\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 5:13 \"13 You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge<strong> the flesh</strong>; rather, serve one another humbly in love.\"</blockquote>\r\nPaul didn't want them to get the idea that sin is now ok because we are no longer under law, we see then he is talking about the whole law. Because, if he had only meant the ceremonial law, they couldn't have possibly taken it as an excuse to sin.\r\n\r\nBut this scripture also provides a turning point in the theme of Galatians somewhat. He has put much effort into showing that they are called to be free, but then he follows up saying not to use your freedom to indulge in the flesh but to serve one another in love.\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 5:15 \"If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.\"</blockquote>\r\nWe will come back to this scripture, it will be useful later on.\r\n<h2>What is the flesh?</h2>\r\nSo this leaves us to question, what is \"the flesh?\" Some people think it means, \"sinful nature,\" or that part of human nature that desires sin. This is accurate and is part of the meaning, but not the whole. For instance,\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 3:3 \"After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by <strong>means of the flesh</strong>?\"</blockquote>\r\nHere the word flesh is used, but not in reference to sin, but to law keeping and human effort. If you look up the greek word for flesh it means both. It means both \"sinful nature\" and \"human effort.\" Essentially the two go hand in hand. We see this exemplified in Romans (I'm going to add in my own words in parenthesis).\r\n<blockquote>Romans 7 \"4 So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. 5 For when we were in the <strong>realm of the flesh </strong>(living according to human effort), the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death. 6 But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.\"\r\n\r\n14 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. 15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. 16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. 17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. 18 For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. 21 So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. 22 For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; 23 but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. 24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? 25 Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!\"</blockquote>\r\nThe word 'sinful nature' is the same word 'flesh.' Basically, under law you live according to human effort not the holy spirit. And your human effort is weak, it cannot do the good you want to do. So the result is when you try to live by it you find yourself unable to overcome sin, since sin is solved through the spirit and not the flesh. This is why Paul shortly after telling the Galatians to use their freedom to do good says,\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 5:16 \"So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe spirit can do what your own willpower cannot do. If he had merely told them to do good, that would not have been enough. They would have been like Paul, wanting to do good but being unable. So he teaches them how to go about doing good, by walking in the spirit. That is not merely saying do good and not bad. The spirit is contrary to human systems and traditions. The spirit brings freedom.\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 5:18 \"But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.\"\r\n\r\n2 Corinthians 3:17 \"Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhen you trust on the spirit, he guides you out of sinful behaviors by showing you the freedom of the gospel. When you put yourself back under human performance, law keeping, traditions, you are no longer walking by the spirit and the end result is you eventually fulfill the desires of the flesh.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 7:5 \"5 For when we were in the realm of the flesh<strong> </strong>(living according to human effort), <strong>the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in us</strong>\"</blockquote>\r\nSin becomes attractive when you are not walking by the spirit. The spirit keeps you in God's freedom, grace, and a revelation of God's love for you (1 Corinthians 2:12). When you chose to walk your own path, ignoring grace, freedom, and love of the Lord you have no gratefulness in your heart that you would want to obey the Lord. Maybe outwardly you boast of your obedience, but inwardly your heart betrays you and you find it acting contrary to your intentions. Now we see a picture of the flesh in a sinful sense.\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 5 \"19 The <strong>acts</strong> of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 20 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the <strong>fruit</strong> of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. 24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 25 Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. 26 Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.\"</blockquote>\r\n'Acts' are something you do out of effort. 'Fruit' is something that is produced in you.\r\n<blockquote>John 15:5 \"I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.\"</blockquote>\r\nNow we come to our passage,\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 6 \"7 Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. 8 Whoever sows to please their flesh, <strong>from the flesh</strong> will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe first and simple translation is that Paul is simply telling us that sin in its nature is destructive. Repeating his words earlier,\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 5:15 \"If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.\"</blockquote>\r\nHe is telling us not to use our freedom as an excuse to sin because even though we are under grace, sin in its nature is destructive and apart from God's intervention will produce bad fruit. On the other hand, when I talk to the Lord about this verse, He keeps showing me a different perspective that I want to share. You see the previous interpretation only looks at flesh as meaning 'sinful nature,' but it doesn't consider the word as meaning 'human effort.' What I felt like the Lord was saying is that sowing to please your flesh is actually putting your trust in your flesh. Trusting in your human effort, traditions, and law keeping to be right with God. The result is you will reap corruption (as some translations put it). Corruption is the same word used in 1 TImothy 6:5, and 2 Peter 1:4 talking of being overcome with sinful passions and actions. Granted this is not the only way its used through the scriptures. But I believe this corruption is not a punishment for sin in the sense of 'you did this wrong, now I will give you a bad day at work,' but of being filled with sinful passions and desires 'from your own flesh.' Remember the sins he listed earlier?\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 5:19-20 \"The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhen you put your trust in your flesh you are no longer walking by the spirit. And when you do not walk by the spirit, \"the sinful passions aroused by the law are at work in you.\" The picture is basically that when you try to keep the law out of human effort you will end up disappointed. You will find sinful behaviors and patterns and all sorts of ungodly desires emerging in you. When you live by human effort you fall from practical grace (Galatians 5:4). Grace is what leads you out of sin.\r\n<blockquote>Titus 2:11-12 \"That grace instructs us to give up ungodly living and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this world,\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 15:10 \"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all — yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.\"</blockquote>\r\nWithout that grace, you have no gratefulness to indebt you to God, the christian life is just a performance drive.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean to sow to 'please' the flesh. Wouldn't that imply enjoying sin?\r\n\r\nYes. But look at it from a different perspective for a moment. What had Paul said through this book?\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 1:10 \"Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to <strong>please</strong> people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 4 \"17 Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, <strong>so that you may have zeal for them</strong>. 18 It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 6 \"12 Those who want <strong>to impress people by means of the flesh</strong> are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ. 13 Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh. 14 May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.\"</blockquote>\r\nSo we see there is a pleasure in sowing to the flesh (in the sense of human effort). It is pride and boasting. They want to appear well before men and take glory because of their works. I believe this is somewhat what it means to be mocking God. God has established righteousness by grace, but these people are somehow thinking that they are more righteous than these gentiles because they keep the traditions of their fathers. However, the result is that because they are walking according to the flesh in the traditions and law of man, grace doesn't have its powerful effect on their lives and the result is they will continue to sin.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 6 \"13 Not even those who are circumcised keep the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your circumcision in the flesh.\"</blockquote>\r\nThey are nullifying God's gift of righteousness and attempting to establish their own. God cannot be mocked, a man-made righteousness does not hold up. God sees the inner thoughts of the heart and he cannot be fooled into thinking that you earned your way into the kingdom. They will reap what they sow, their human effort and human righteousness will betray them.\r\n\r\nSo I don't believe we can take this passage to say that the law of karma is the law christians live by. Yes, in some sense there is a natural order where sin is destructive, but on the other hand, our sin does not stop God's grace, it multiplies it.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 5:20 \"The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more\"</blockquote>\r\nDoes this mean we can go on sinning? By no means. If you walk by the spirit you will not fulfill the lusts of the flesh and you will reap a reward in due time.\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 6:8 \"whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. 9 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. 10 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.\"</blockquote>\r\nLiving by human effort will produce the acts of the flesh, things that are corrupted and bring no reward. But walking by the spirit, living in a way that is pleasing to God brings life abundantly. Since we have this reward of eternal life and grace, let us live in a manner that is worthy of it. Let us use our freedom to build each other up.",

          "content:encoded": "I have received a lot of questions from people about how I hear God's voice and what He sounds like. It's my heart that everybody learn how to hear God's voice so I wanted to take an article teaching the same things I learned. So buckle your seat belt! We are going to go on an adventure to learn how to hear God's voice for yourself. The Lord told me to teach this message today and said\r\n<blockquote><span style=\"color:#008080;\">“<span style=\"font-family:'Adobe Garamond Pro', sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Show them how I spoke to those who did not know me. (Paul). Show them how I poured my spirit upon all flesh and they would prophecy. Show them how I revealed myself to the gentiles and did not distinguish between them and the jews but poured my spirit upon them all. Show them the mystery of my will. Give them a taste of what its like to hear my voice and let them discover for themselves that experience. I tell you I will work in the hearts of everyone you preach to and give them confidence that they too can hear my voice.”</span></span></span></blockquote>\r\nSo I want to start by looking at the scriptures and then I will show you the practical side, as far as I know, so that you may have a head start in hearing God's voice. I am not the all in all expert on talking with God. I can lay a foundation, but ultimately it will be God himself and the Holy Spirit within you that teaches you more about hearing his voice. I will teach you how to hear from that spirit.\r\n\r\nI grew up in a church that believed that God speaks to us today and we practiced hearing his voice in prophecy and words of knowledge. Even in third grade sunday school we would practice hearing from the Lord and those words were confirmed as being true and having come from him. I remember one of the members of our class was prophesying over a lady in our church and she said, \"I see a picture of an angel crushing a coke can beneath his feet.\" We all laughed because that seemed odd. However at the end of the prophecy, the lady began to give us feedback on the words she had received and she said that vision was the most accurate because she had been trying to stop drinking coke for the past few weeks. (I'm not saying coke is bad. Decide that for yourself.)\r\n\r\nThese kind of coincidences and confirmations happened on a regular basis. People would prophecy events that were yet to come and those events would occur just as had been prophesied. For instance I got a word for one young man in which the Lord showed me that he loved math and would be tutoring in math. The man immediately said he did love math and it was his favorite thing to do. Two weeks later he told me that he had been offered a math tutoring job that he was really enjoying. All these things showed us that God does indeed speak today and that we all can learn to hear his voice.\r\n\r\nNow I struggled in hearing God's voice. There were times where it seemed like others could hear Him so well and I wouldn't get very much. But as I continued to learn from the Lord he taught me that hearing his voice is not just for the mature christians, its for everyone, and he will speak to us anytime. Today, anywhere, anytime, I can sit down and hear from God. We have conversations as long as we like with no interruptions. It is very easy. I don't always hear perfect and sometimes I struggle with discernment, but usually the things I hear prove to be true. So I want to share with you the things I was taught so that you may not be in the dark when it comes to knowing your Father.\r\n<h3>Don't compare yourself to others or feel bad if you struggle to hear God</h3>\r\nWe hear God's voice for our sakes, not for his. You can be a good christian and never hear God's voice. He wants you to hear His voice, but that is not what makes you a qualified christian. Don't think less of yourself if you don't hear God's voice as well as someone else or start comparing your relationship with God to others.\r\n<h2>Faulty beliefs</h2>\r\nBoth the religious community and the world have a lot of thoughts about hearing God's voice. The world considers hearing God's voice foolishness. You may have heard of the \"clockmaker theory.\" It is a vain philosophy that says that God created the universe but does not engage in its affairs. He created it like a clock that runs on its own and only needs to be looked at from time to time. These people would think that the idea of a christian interacting with God is unprovable and silly.\r\n\r\nSometimes the church in their ignorance gives into these thoughts as well. They may say things like, God does not not speak to us personally but only through the scriptures. However anyone who reads the scriptures will know that God also speaks to us through the spirit. In the times of Martin Luther, the church believed that only the priests could correctly discern the Bible and the rest had to hear God's will through those men. They forbid people to discern the scriptures for themselves and only wrote bibles in a language that the priests could understand.\r\n\r\nSometimes we see the same mentality today. We think that only the \"mature\" christians or leaders in the church are given the privilege to know God's will and hear God's voice and that the average christian does not have that privilege and it is even dangerous for an average christian to hear the Lord's voice for themselves. Granted, some have abused hearing the Lord's voice saying that they heard things that they actually did not. But hasn't the church done the same things from time to time with the Bible, falsely interpreting the scriptures and binding people with a religion that the Bible doesn't teach? My point is that anything good can be abused yet that doesn't make it illegitimate. The scriptures, God's voice, the grace of God, etc... can all be misused, but that doesn't mean we need to shy away from it and consider all acts of those things as dangerous and illegitimate. The reason I say all this is because whether we realize it or not, we often have bought into some of these silly beliefs and they will only serve to hinder you from experiencing the Lord.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>God doesn't speak anymore</li>\r\n\t<li>God doesn't want to speak to me today.</li>\r\n\t<li>God only speaks to the ideal christian.</li>\r\n\t<li>God doesn't have much to say.</li>\r\n\t<li>God is withholding his voice so that I will obey him more and seek him.</li>\r\n\t<li>I have to be in a special place or sense to hear him.</li>\r\n\t<li>God only speaks under certain circumstances.</li>\r\n\t<li>God only speaks when he needs to, but he doesn't want to talk with me just for fun.</li>\r\n\t<li>God will stop speaking to me until I've obeyed that last thing he told me.</li>\r\n\t<li>God only speaks to those who pursue him and practice hearing his voice. It will take me years of practice to learn how to hear him.</li>\r\n\t<li>God isn't interested in me.</li>\r\n\t<li>I just can't hear him</li>\r\n\t<li>You have to have a special gift from God in order to hear him. Only some people can hear God that way.</li>\r\n\t<li>God is speaking in a different way than I know so I can't hear him.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you have any of these beliefs or if one of these offended you, consider carefully what you believe. I know a few of these are offensive and they offended me. But, they will keep you from hearing his voice clearly. So long as you are telling God what he can and can't do you are controlling him. You need to step back and let God be God and not follow manmade wisdom that perverts the gospel and keeps you from hearing him continually. God is a speaking God. All through the bible from genesis to revelation he was speaking.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 2 \"When I came to you, I did not come with eloquence or human wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God. 2 For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. 3 I came to you in weakness with great fear and trembling. 4 My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit’s power, 5 so that your faith might not rest on human wisdom, but on God’s power.\r\n\r\n6 We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing. 7 No, we declare God’s wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. 8 None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 9 However, as it is written:\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n“What no eye has seen,\r\nwhat no ear has heard,\r\nand what no human mind has conceived”—\r\nthe things God has prepared for those who love him—\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n10 these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.11 For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 12 What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us.13 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words. 14 The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. 15 The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments, 16 for,\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n“Who has known the mind of the Lord\r\nso as to instruct him?”\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nBut we have the mind of Christ.\r\n\r\n3:1 Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly—mere infants in Christ.\r\n\r\n18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become “fools” so that you may become wise. 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”; 20 and again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.” 21 So then, no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours, 22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours, 23 and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhen we ask the Lord to give us wisdom we need to have our hearts open to consider what he says. Sometimes we have grown so fond of our own understanding that we reject anything he says because it contradicts what we think we know. We need to learn to trust in what the Lord says without letting the wisdom of this world deter us.\r\n<blockquote>Proverbs 3:5-6 \"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; 6 in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.\"</blockquote>\r\nSo learn to suspend your intellect as you talk to the Lord so that you don't miss something he may be saying to you. The scriptures teach us that God speaks to man and worldly wisdom says God doesn't speak. We must consider which wisdom we value more.\r\n\r\nSo no more foolish rules about when, how, and where God can and can't speak. We must lay down that ignorance if we are to truly become wise.\r\n<h2>God speaks to everybody</h2>\r\nAccording to the scripture above we learn that no one knows a man's thoughts except a man's spirit in him. He goes on to say that we have received the spirit from God that we may know everything that he has given us. Therefore since we have the mind of Christ through the spirit, we may hear God's thoughts. But you may ask, would God have anything to say to me? Is he even interested in talking to me?\r\n<blockquote>Psalm 139\r\n\r\n1 You have searched me, Lord,\r\nand you know me.\r\n2 You know when I sit and when I rise;\r\nyou perceive my thoughts from afar.\r\n3 You discern my going out and my lying down;\r\nyou are familiar with all my ways.\r\n4 Before a word is on my tongue\r\nyou, Lord, know it completely.\r\n5 You hem me in behind and before,\r\nand you lay your hand upon me.\r\n6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,\r\ntoo lofty for me to attain.\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n7 Where can I go from your Spirit?\r\nWhere can I flee from your presence?\r\n8 If I go up to the heavens, you are there;\r\nif I make my bed in the depths, you are there.\r\n9 If I rise on the wings of the dawn,\r\nif I settle on the far side of the sea,\r\n10 even there your hand will guide me,\r\nyour right hand will hold me fast.\r\n11 If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me\r\nand the light become night around me,”\r\n12 even the darkness will not be dark to you;\r\nthe night will shine like the day,\r\nfor darkness is as light to you.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n13 For you created my inmost being;\r\nyou knit me together in my mother’s womb.\r\n14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made;\r\nyour works are wonderful,\r\nI know that full well.\r\n15 My frame was not hidden from you\r\nwhen I was made in the secret place,\r\nwhen I was woven together in the depths of the earth.\r\n16 Your eyes saw my unformed body;\r\nall the days ordained for me were written in your book\r\nbefore one of them came to be.\r\n17 How precious to me are your thoughts, God!\r\nHow vast is the sum of them!\r\n18 Were I to count them,\r\nthey would outnumber the grains of sand—\r\nwhen I awake, I am still with you.\r\n\r\nLuke 12 \"6 Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. 7 Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.\"\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nYou see, God IS interested in you. He has more thoughts than the sands on the sea. He numbers your every hair!!! Why would God not want to speak with you?\r\n\r\nNow, if through the spirit you can know God's thoughts and if he has more thoughts towards you than the sands on the sea, then why would you think that God would stop speaking to you?\r\n<blockquote>John 14 \"16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and <strong>be with you forever</strong>— 17 the Spirit of truth. <strong>The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.</strong> 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. 19 Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.\"\r\n\r\nJohn 16 \"7 But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, <strong>I will send him to you</strong>.\"\r\n\r\n12 “I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. 13 But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come. 14 He will glorify me because it is from me that he will receive what he will make known to you. 15 All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will receive from me what he will make known to you.\r\n\r\n17:20 “My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message, 21 <strong>that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.</strong>\r\n\r\n1 John 2 \"26 These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you. 27 As for you, the anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need for anyone to teach you; but <strong>as His anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie</strong>, and just as it has taught you, you abide in Him.\"\r\n\r\nDo you not know that your bodies <strong>are temples of the Holy Spirit</strong>, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own</blockquote>\r\nWe can see from these passages that when Jesus was around, he taught the disciples personally. But he said that it was to their advantage that he went away. Why? Because he was sending them the spirit of truth, which is the Holy Spirit to teach them. He said that spirit would be in them and in everyone who believes and would never leave. The spirit doesn't not speak on his own, he only speaks what the father is saying. You therefore can know what the father is saying if indeed you have the spirit in you.\r\n<h2>All believers have the Holy Spirit</h2>\r\n<blockquote>Acts 2 \"14Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: “Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. 15 These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning! 16No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n17“ ‘In the last days, God says,\r\n\r\n<strong>I will pour out my Spirit on all people.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Your sons and daughters will prophesy</strong>,\r\n\r\nyour young men will see visions,\r\n\r\nyour old men will dream dreams.\r\n\r\n18Even on my servants, both men and women,\r\n\r\nI will pour out my Spirit in those days,\r\n\r\nand they will prophesy.\r\n\r\n19I will show wonders in the heavens above\r\n\r\nand signs on the earth below,\r\n\r\nblood and fire and billows of smoke.\r\n\r\n20The sun will be turned to darkness\r\n\r\nand the moon to blood\r\n\r\nbefore the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.\r\n\r\n21And everyone who calls\r\n\r\non the name of the Lord will be saved.’\"\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nPeter was saying that these are the last days and that God has poured his spirit upon all flesh.\r\n<blockquote>Acts 15 \"8 God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us.\"</blockquote>\r\nHere he refers to the gentiles vs the jews. That God poured out his spirit onto the gentiles through faith. Whenever someone would believe in Christ, God would give that person his spirit.\r\n<blockquote>Acts 10 \"44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. 45 The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles. 46 For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God.\r\n\r\nThen Peter said, 47 “Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.”\"</blockquote>\r\nGod was not speaking to the twelve disciples only when he promised them the spirit, he spoke to all who would believe in his name. Galatians 1:12 also shows us a practical example of learning from the spirit.\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 1:12 \"I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe spirit himself spoke to Paul and taught him the mysteries of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nNow some will say that God only speaks to those who \"seek\" him. However Paul, who was once Saul is a primary example against this. Saul didn't want anything to do with christianity, yet God intervened and spoke to him, even though Saul did not \"pursue\" him. God also pursued and revealed himself to the gentiles so that they might know him.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 10 \"'Their voice has gone out into all the earth,\r\n<div>\r\n\r\ntheir words to the ends of the world.'<sup>\r\n</sup>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n19Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says,\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n“I will make you envious by those who are not a nation;\r\n\r\nI will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding.”<sup>j</sup>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n20And Isaiah boldly says,\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n“<strong>I was found by those who did not seek me;</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.</strong>”\"\r\n\r\nEphesians 3 \"For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles— 2 Surely you have heard about the administration of God’s grace that was given to me for you, 3 that is, the <strong>mystery made known to me by revelation</strong>, as I have already written briefly. 4 In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, 5 which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been <strong>revealed by the Spirit</strong> to God’s holy apostles and prophets. 6 <strong>This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel</strong>, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.\"\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nThe mystery is that God gave the spirit to the gentiles who believed in Christ even though they weren't jewish. Therefore, you too, when you believe receive the spirit. And when you receive the spirit, you receive the ability to hear God's voice. The Holy Spirit guides you into all truth. God does not distinguish between certain types of christians when he speaks to us. He speaks to all freely.\r\n<blockquote>James 1:5 \"If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.\"</blockquote>\r\nGod is not finding fault with you before he will speak to you, he gives to all freely.\r\n<h2>How to hear God's voice</h2>\r\nI hope I've convinced you through the scriptures that God continues to speak today. But you may ask. What does God's voice sound like? How do I know I'm hearing him?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, these are questions that the spirit of truth will teach you. But the bible tells us the nature of God's voice.\r\n<blockquote>James 3:17 \"But the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and good deeds. It shows no favoritism and is always sincere.\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 14:3 \"But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort.\"\r\n\r\n2 Corinthians 1:3-5 \"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. For as we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.\"</blockquote>\r\nGod's voice will always bring peace and comfort, not confusion. It will be pure and loving and bear good fruit and not be unsettling or distressing. It will be encouraging, strengthening, and will come in gentleness. God words will always be full of mercy without giving special attention to some over others. This means all are qualified to hear his voice and He does not distinguish between who you are or what gifting you have.\r\n\r\nThe spirit does not contradict himself. Therefore anything God tells you will be confirmed in the scripture. You cannot say you have heard God if that word does not resonate with the scripture. However, there are times where our understanding of the scripture is incorrect. In those times God may say something that at first seems to contradict what we know but upon further study we find that he was actually correct. So God's word will never contradict scripture, but sometimes it will contradict our faulty understanding of scripture.\r\n\r\nAnytime you hear God's voice, it will line up with the scripture, be in God's nature, and bear good fruit. If its not in God's nature or down the road you realize that it isn't bearing good fruit in your life then no matter how much like God it sounded, it was not of Him. Thus you recognize God's words by their nature and by the spirit within you. The Holy Spirit causes you to distinguish between knowing your thoughts and God's thoughts. We need to be careful when we hear God's voice, but we don't need to be afraid, for he Holy Spirit will lead us into all truth. Especially in those times when we go astray thinking we've heard God when we actually haven't.\r\n<h2>How does God speak?</h2>\r\nGlad you asked. Now we are jumping into more of the practical side of hearing God's voice. God can speak any way He wants to. But He usually chooses to speak to you in a way that you hear Him best and in a way that you are most comfortable with. For some that is the special revelations in the bible (which of course we all hear God through). Others have dreams and visions. And others it is a voice inside their heart or thoughts in their mind. A few hear an audible voice. For some it is an intuitive sense they get in their spirit. Some get feelings or sudden revelations and knowledge about things that didn't come from them. All these things are the work of the spirit and there are many other ways God can speak.\r\n\r\nLet me ask you a question. Where does the Holy Spirit dwell? In you? Then that's where you will hear God from. He doesn't make it difficult to hear his voice. Its easy to dismiss these thoughts and feelings as just belonging to yourself. But you need to learn how to suspend your intellect and take the risk of considering that what you are getting may in fact be coming from God.\r\n\r\nSo do this with me. First I want you to look at an object in your space. And I want you to say to yourself, \"That object is red.\" Or whatever color it is. Don't say it out loud, but think it in your mind. Take a break now and do that.\r\n\r\nCould you hear yourself say that? Could you hear your voice say \"That object is red?\" That is one way that God can speak to you and it may sound like that.\r\n\r\nNow in a moment I want you to try something else with me. Close your eyes and ask God this question. \"What do you think of me?\" or \"What's your favorite thing to do?\"\r\n\r\nThen I want you to write or type down whatever you hear in response, even if you think its your own thoughts. If you get a sense, describe it. If you hear a thought, write it down. If you get a picture or memory describe it. Ok, go ahead and take that break.\r\n\r\nWhat did you get? Feel free to comment below if you'd like. I will try to make sure my spam filter does not throw away your message!!!!\r\n\r\nI felt like God told me that I was full of the Holy Spirit. This means he is pleased with this article and me. He is glad that he is getting to talk to all of you.\r\n<h2>So what if I didn't hear anything?</h2>\r\nDon't give up! Keep listening. I didn't hear much my first time either. Just continue to talk to God and take time to listen for a reply. If the problem persists it may be one of those silly beliefs holding you back. If so, ask the Lord to remove anything that might hinder you from hearing him. If suddenly you remember something you believe wrongly about the matter, confess that to him and repent of it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of you may be trying to hard. Its not hard to hear God's voice. Try not to use too much discernment as you are listening. It is possible to discern your way right out of hearing God's voice. Your discernment can be weak and fleshly, so write down whatever you get and use discernment afterward. Discernment needs to be kept simple. If it was peaceful, full of life, freeing, merciful, full of good fruit, comforting, encouraging, strengthening, not contradicting the bible, then it was probably of God. If on the other hand, it was frightening, unnerving, unsettling, confusing, or unclear then dismiss it. God will not be upset with you for dismissing something you in good conscience don't think is God's voice. He knows the difficulty we have sometimes learning to hear from the spirit and He's ok if we sometimes get it wrong, mishear him, or throw away something that was actually Him. Just let Him give you grace for that and continue practicing. And if something you hear is unclear, ask the Lord for a Bible verse, or ask him to speak through the people around you, or give the word time to play out and see if it really came from the Lord.\r\n\r\nDon't be discouraged if you didn't hear him the first time. Just ask again and wait. And if you don't hear him again, pray that he would speak to you all the time and continue asking him until he does. He will not turn you away.\r\n\r\nAnd not hearing God's voice does not mean anything of your faith or character. Sometimes we have small beliefs that get in the way. But do not fear, the Holy Spirit will dismantle those if you let him. Not hearing anything does not mean God doesn't like you or doesn't want to talk with you. It just means you are practicing and need some time to learn. Continue to take time to listen to God and ask him questions, He will speak to you.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps you to begin your journey in hearing God's voice! Feel free to ask questions below!\r\n<h3>Word of Caution</h3>\r\nBe careful when it comes to hearing God's voice with dates, mates, babies, or deaths or other sensitive issues. These things in their nature have a lot of emotion behind them and can sometimes throw us for a loop when we are honestly trying to hear the Lord's voice. When hearing the Lord in these matters, listen to the people close to you since they also have the Holy Spirit in them and see if they also feel like it is from the Lord. Don't be discouraged to the point that you give up on hearing God's voice if you hear Him wrong in one of these areas. Many people have heard the Lord correctly in these matters, including most of our favorite bible characters, but many people including myself have had our sub-conscious play games with us when it comes to honestly trying to hear the Lord's voice in these matters.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

          "content:encoded": "<blockquote>\"Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by eating ceremonial foods, which is of no benefit to those who do so\" (Hebrews 13:9).</blockquote>\r\nI have not had much time to write now that I am in the school season and I am studying to be a web designer, however, I have seen many of my friends sink into confusion and depression because they don't have confidence in the voice of their Teacher.\r\n\r\nWhat can happen, is that a message will become popular. A preacher will say something boldly and carelessly without examination and his listeners end up repeating that to others. If we hear that message from our pastor and the people around us often enough, we come to accept it as unquestionable truth. So I see students giving up on their convictions, convictions that are good and healthy, and falling deeper into unhealthy religion that is causing all kinds of problems even general anxiety disorder and OCD.\r\n\r\nWe have not been taught to regard the personal voice of God in our daily lives and the wisdom that comes from the Spirit. <a title=\"Hearing God’s Voice\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/07/28/hearing-gods-voice/\">God has given us his Spirit so that we may hear his voice and know his will in our lives</a>. I am not saying simply through reading the Bible only, I mean in your own heart and mind with inspired thoughts and revelations directly from the Spirit. However, we are taught that hearing God in this way is dangerous for individuals and not recommended. This is an extension of the same belief that plagued the people in the time of Martin Luther. The church leaders of that time believed that the Bible could only be correctly interpreted by the priests and that it would be dangerous if the average person could interpret the Bible for themselves. Today, we allow everyone to read and interpret the Bible but some of that mentality remains. Sometimes we think that only the \"super-christians,\" that is the ideal christians or church leaders, are gifted with the ability to hear God's voice and know His will, but that God doesn't speak to the average person. \"Can you imagine how dangerous it would be if everyone could hear God's voice for themselves?\" So we warn people against trusting in the voice of God because we cannot control it or always prove if we heard him correctly. We point people back to the Bible, but we do so exclusively, saying, \"God has said all he needs to say in his book.\" However, what we don't realize is that we are just as insecure at interpreting the Bible correctly. The Bible is indeed the infallible word of God and contains complete truth, but the Bible was written to a different people, at a different time, in a different culture, with different concerns, with a different language. No wonder we have so many denominations and professionals who have argued over correct interpretation for centuries! What this tells us is that although we cannot always prove if we truly hear God's voice, neither can we always say that we perfectly understand the Bible. Error can come both ways.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Author of the Bible understands his word perfectly and only he can perfectly interpret the whole Bible. That is why it is important to learn to hear His voice and let the Spirit guide us in how to read the scriptures. Why do we trust the works of the Author but not the Author himself? Why do we trust in our understanding of the Bible but we do not trust in the wisdom that comes from the Spirit. Does not the Author know his work the best? When we fear a living relationship with God and say the Bible is all we need, we have cut out the core of the Christian faith.\r\n<blockquote>\"You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life\" (John 5:39-40).</blockquote>\r\nSo then, when we read the word it must bring us into deeper relationship with Christ and not further removed from him. This means learning to hear from Him and trust the words he says, not just the ones written in the Bible, but the ones he gives us in our daily lives through the Spirit.\r\n\r\nHowever, my concern is that people have not been taught how to have confidence in the things they feel like God is telling them. They have been warned over and over of all the horror stories of people who claimed they heard God and were completely wrong. They are taught that hearing God is a dangerous thing and can get you into trouble. The result is most people are uncomfortable with the idea of \"hearing from God\" and they are slow to believe they have heard from Him.\r\n\r\nThere is however some validity to this warning. People in history have misheard God intentionally and unintentionally. And God's word must be backed up in the Bible because God will never contradict himself. Not only that, but anything that comes from God must line up with his character and produce good fruit in our lives. If it is not Biblical, not in line with God's character, and it doesn't produce good fruit, then it is not of God even if someone says it is.\r\n\r\nBut there is something to be said for when we have heard God correctly yet dismiss it because we are afraid to trust Him for fear of being wrong. Sometimes if I feel like God has told me something that I am not sure is true, then I will ask him for a scripture to back it up. If he gives me a scripture that fulfills what He said in context, then I believe Him. If I do not get a scripture I usually throw out what I heard or wait until more proof is given. There will be times when we hear Him right and times where we mishear him. However, God's grace will continually cover our mistakes as we honestly try to discern what's he's saying.\r\n\r\nSo what happens is, in someone's personal time with God, they will hear wonderfully encouraging things from Him but then later, when they listen to their pastor or friend, they will hear some discouraging things that conflict with what God had told them earlier. And because that individual does not have confidence in what God has said, he forgets that word of encouragement and falls back into bondage. No one has told them that God is actually more reliable than the pastor or popular opinion.\r\n\r\nI grew up with this mentality, that I was permitted to hear from God as long as it didn't conflict with anything my pastor said or what people in general thought. And there is a wisdom in this. It is a wordily wisdom, but wisdom none the less. There can be times when I believe I have heard God and defy the warnings from others and fall into trouble. This is why I never want to dogmatically claim I have perfectly heard from God or be arrogant with what I think I know. I know one day I will mishear Him and need people's grace to cover me. It is also good to rely on the counsel of many at times. However, \"the many\" can be just as incorrect and unreliable as hearing personally from God. Throughout these years as I have been talking with God, He has been teaching and convicting me over and over with how little trust I actually place in his words. Actually, it's not that I don't trust his words, it's that I don't trust my ability to hear him clearly. However, this becomes my excuse for everything. God will tell me my salvation is secure, but the next day a pastor will warn us against loosing our salvation and I will lean more towards what my pastor says than what I feel the Lord is telling me. When I can, I depend on my conviction of the Bible, but there are times where I honestly don't understand the Bible. I read and study and find myself in a mess because one scripture says one thing but another seems to say something opposing.\r\n\r\nI was taught growing up that if enough people thought you were wrong then you had not heard God correctly. But this is also misguided. Public opinion can easily be swayed by a popular message. At one point people used to fear generational curses greatly and came out with many systems of how to remove generational curse. As a young man, the Lord had showed me not to worry about it, but the people around me and my leaders insisted that it was necessary to say the 7-step prayer and perform the removal ceremony to cleanse the curse. At that time, because I was taught not to trust in God's words I believed the majority and lost my peace of mind. For a few years, I was concerned about some old curse haunting me because I hadn't performed the ceremony correctly. Today, that message has lost a lot of popularity because people have realized it's unscriptural.\r\n\r\nOver and over the Lord would tell me things that would conflict with majority opinion and I would hesitate to take the risk of believing Him. However, as the years rolled out, public opinion would shift and suddenly they would favor the things the Lord had told me. Not only that, but over time the Lord would begin giving me scriptures that confirmed what he had said, and not flimsy scriptures taken out of context, but defined scriptures within their point. I learned to trust more in the voice of God than what the popular opinion around me said. And as I began trusting in God, my life became much more peaceful and joyful. I was no longer confused and tossed back and forth by every sermon I heard. I would continually be comforted and encouraged by the words of my Father that I believed in and trusted. The word of God within stabilized me and protected me from the whims of wordily wisdom. Church leaders don't always have the ability to help us distinguish what is of God and what is not so some make over-arching rules to keep people in check. \"Don't listen to it if it sounds out of the box or out of conformity with our own expectations.\" And of course we know that God would never say something out of the box.\r\n<blockquote>Acts 11:1-18 \"The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him and said, “You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.” Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story: “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was. I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds. Then I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’ “I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ “The voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’ This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again. “Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house. He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.’ \"As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning. Then I remembered what the Lord had said: ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God’s way?” When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, “So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.”</blockquote>\r\nCan you image what our faith would have been like if Peter had trusted in popular opinion and not relied on what God was saying? Yet, somehow we think it is wise that we disregard the words of God if they conflict with a popular belief.\r\n\r\nI am not saying there is no wisdom in the counsel of many. On many matters dealing with wordily issues, wordily counsel is profitable. However, when it comes to your personal relationship with God, no one can teach you better than God himself.\r\n<blockquote>\"As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him\" (1 John 2:27).</blockquote>\r\nIn the context of this verse, these Christians were facing oppression from popular opinion because of the teachings of the anti-christ. He was reminding them, that they were not being foolish or ignorant, but that God indeed had and was teaching them and they needed to have confidence in what God had said.\r\n<blockquote>\"No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, 'Know the LORD,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,\" declares the LORD. \"For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more\" (Jeremiah 31:34).\r\n\"And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever-- the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you\" (John 14:16-17).\r\n\r\n\"But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you\" (John 14:26).\r\n\r\n\"All your children will be taught by the LORD, and great will be their peace\" (Isaiah 54:13).\r\n\r\n\"All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you\" (Philippines 3:15).\r\n\r\nThen Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: “The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. 3 So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. “Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others. “But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father,and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted\" (Matthew 23:1-12).</blockquote>\r\nWe trust in what our pastor says and usually it is good too. We also trust in public opinion and sometimes there is wisdom in the majority. But we must trust the Lord more than we trust these people, even when there is a chance that we may have heard him incorrectly. It is wise to trust the Lord and not to lean on the wisdom of man.\r\n<blockquote>\"The wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy\" <em>(<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+3%3A17&amp;version=47\" target=\"_new\">James 3:17</a>).</em>\r\n\r\n\"Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming\" (Ephesians 4:14).\r\n\r\n\"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world\" (John 4:1)\r\n\r\n\"There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end it leads to death\" (Proverbs 14:12).\r\n\r\n\"The discerning heart seeks knowledge, but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly\" (Proverbs 15:14).\r\n\r\n\"Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you —for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others\" <em>(<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+7%3A21-22&amp;version=47\" target=\"_new\">Ecclesiastes 7:21-22</a>).</em>\r\n\r\n\"Every word of God is flawless; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. Do not add to His words, or He will rebuke you and prove you a liar\" <em>(<a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+30%3A5-6&amp;version=47\" target=\"_new\">Proverbs 30:5-6</a>).</em></blockquote>\r\nSo take confidence in what you honestly feel the Lord is telling you. And do so in humility, not arrogantly, being open to correction if the need may arise. The Lord wants to teach us personally even if there is a danger of hearing Him wrong. We must be taught to regard the things God says and not shy away from his words in exchange for the words of man.",

          "content:encoded": "I have been told my articles can be too lengthy for people with tighter schedules so I 'm going to do my best to create shortened versions of my articles so they can read as well. The full version is here: <a title=\"Hebrews 6 – Falling Away\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/hebrews-6/\">Hebrews 6 - Falling Away</a>.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most confusing scriptures in the Bible, but I believe the correct interpretation heavily relies on the context of the entire book. I am not a scholar, and I do not claim to know everything correctly, but I trust in the Holy Spirit to give me wisdom in how I read the scriptures, and I would like to share what I feel like came from him.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 6:4-8 “It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace. Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God. But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.”</blockquote>\r\nI believe this passage is parallel with the story of the Israelites coming into the promise land, which has already been referenced heavily by the author in the previous chapters. The Israelites heard God's promise of giving them the Land but instead they were afraid of the giants and didn't believe God. Because they didn't believe, they missed out on all the blessings God wanted to give them such as having wells they did not dig, vineyards they did not plant, houses they did not build. The author references this land as the \"rest\" of God. But, that was not God's true rest. God has provided a final rest for the believer through Christ.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 4:8-11 \"For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day. There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; For all who have entered into God’s rest have <strong>rested from their labors, </strong>just as God did after creating the world. So let us do our best to enter that rest. But if we disobey God, as the people of Israel did, we <strong>will fall</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nJesus's sacrifice provides us every good thing in his kingdom freely. We are given a justification we did not build, righteousness we did not plant, and an inheritance we did not dig, so to speak. This means we no longer need to be trying to earn merits before God, or perform useless religious deeds in order to obtain God's favor but are called to \"rest from our labors.\" Those useless rituals only serve to mock what Jesus did for us. Let's read a couple verses before this passage.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 6:1 “Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of <strong>repentance from dead works and of faith toward God</strong>,\"</blockquote>\r\nThis is the only other place in Hebrews where the word \"repentance\" is used besides Hebrews 12:17. It is repentance from dead works. The context of dead works and how they are referenced throughout Hebrews indicate that they are not so much referring to sin as we think of it but instead to useless religious deeds such as circumcision, animal sacrifices, cleanings and washings, observing sabbaths, special moons, or any other act which a man may invent to make himself right with God. Instead of trusting these religious deeds, we put our faith in God and what he did in us through Christ and enter his \"rest.\"\r\n\r\nSo the purpose of the passage is to direct us away from performing these useless deeds by showing us that they will be worthless in the end and will steal from our experience the rest we are privileged to enjoy. Thus the recipients of this message are falling away (not from salvation) but from God's rest, and turning to dead works as a means to be right with God. To their loss their deeds only mock what Jesus did and ridicule his death. People who sow in love that comes from receiving the rest of God reap a harvest, but works that are useless to God in the end will be burned. So if you want to perform works that matter and are useful to God, don't fall into worthless rituals. But God is not unjust and he will not forget to reward the labor of love you give out of genuine faith in God.\r\n<h2>Impossible to renew to repentance \"as long as\"</h2>\r\nThis idea that it's impossible to renew them to repentance hinges on the fact that they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace. The International Standard Version emphasizes this.\r\n<blockquote>and who have fallen away,<strong> as long as they continue to</strong> crucify the Son of God to their own detriment by exposing him to public ridicule (International Standard Version).</blockquote>\r\nSeveral scholars including the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges and Robert Dean Luginbill argue this. You can read the<a title=\"https://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/hebrews-6/\" href=\"https://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/hebrews-6/\" target=\"_blank\"> long version</a> of this article for their quotes.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that if at some point they turn away from crucifying Christ afresh they may be restored to repentance. Repentance from what? Useless rituals such as the animal sacrifices. He's basically saying it's impossible for them to enter into God's full rest while continuing these rituals because they don't understand Jesus's once and for all sacrifice. This he goes on to explain all through Hebrews how Jesus was not like their other animal sacrifices being offered over and over, but was offered once and for all, so that those old rituals could be completely done away with.\r\n\r\nSo I might translate this passage as follows:\r\n<blockquote>It is impossible for those who have heard and been invited into God's promised rest, if they ignore His gift to be brought back to repentance from their useless rituals so long as they suppose the Son of God's death was ineffective or must be offered over and over like their other animal sacrifices both subjecting him to shame and doing themselves detriment. Works that come from love spurred by faith are useful to God and obtain a blessing. But, the useless deeds and rituals of legalism and doubt are worthless to God. In the end they will be burned.”</blockquote>\r\nHope this helps! I don't believe this passage is talking about loosing salvation, but is instead trying to open our eyes to the rest our salvation provides and helping us to see how useless those old rituals have become since Christ has cleansed us once and for all.",

          "content:encoded": "I want to talk about how grace leads to a godly lifestyle. Have you ever watched Extreme Makeover: Home Edition? I love it when the family finally sees their new home. I don't know if you've had the chance to notice how some of the people react. On a couple occasions the father would break down and say through tears, \"Thank you! I am going to be a better man!\"\r\n\r\nThere is something very deep and genuine that happens in our hearts when we have been shown exceptional kindness. It's a kindness that makes you want to go and make someone else happy, go out of your way for someone else, or be \"a better man.\" Can you recall a time in your life when someone showed you exceptional kindness? Do you recall how you felt?\r\n\r\nPerhaps some awe? Gratefulness? Peace and joy? Renewed hope and spirit? Love? A passion to return the favor or to believe in the good in man? Did it create a new admiration for that person?\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that you probably didn't take that kindness as a means to promote a negative lifestyle. If the bank cancelled your debt, did that make you want to go and teach that debt is a good thing? Most likely not! In fact, I would have expected you to want to return the favor to the bank somehow. Jesus says it like this.\r\n<blockquote><b>Luke 7:41-47 </b>“Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”\r\n\r\nSimon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.”\r\n\r\n“You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.\r\n\r\nThen he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her <strong>many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown</strong>. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.”</blockquote>\r\nWhen we get a grasp on the grace of God and receive the freedom to be in awe of his kindness, our hearts will go through a similar transformation like this woman. A true understanding of grace does not lead to a licentious life of sin, such people have never understood grace. Grace becomes the seed that begets love for God. Gratefulness is the motivation of New Covenant works. New Covenant works are not another law that will earn us God's kindness, it is a response to God's kindness springing from a heart overflowing with gratitude. That is why I and others preach grace so passionately. We want to see people overflowing with with thankfulness for what God has done for them and to see their lives be full of joy and peace and good works done cheerfully not just from compulsion. Sometimes the way we teach about God's grace, we limit and blind ourselves to how good it really is. That's why it's important not to be mixing in the old covenant with the glory of the new. Without a whole New Covenant, we are left with people who are incredibly blessed, but don't know it, aren't grateful, and don't really have the motivation to love others unconditionally.\r\n\r\nSo let's think about the kindness that the Lord wants to show us, and not add any \"if's\" onto it. I wouldn't have expected those families on Extreme Makeover to have felt so loved if there was doubt that the house wouldn't be theirs. Let's not let the lies of the enemy and this world distract us from seeing just how much hope, life, kindness, and love we can really experience. This week, let God amaze you with his kindness.",

Like most Christians, enough is enough when things are going down the drain for 3 years and I'm finding it hard just to rise for another day. But this man pulled me out of the marsh with his teachings. I am a living testimony of this truth and the power of the grace gospel!",

          "content:encoded": "I am very thankful to have grown up in a family and a church that practiced these virtues regularly. However, as time has gone on, my appreciation and value of these virtues have grown and I want to encourage you to find the life they hide to those who seek them.\r\n<blockquote>Titus 3:1-2 \"Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people.\"\r\n\r\nEphesians 4:1-2 \"Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,\"</blockquote>\r\nToday I was in a driving situation where the cars were slowing down in front of me for no apparent reason. I began to feel that sense of impatience, urgency, and frustration in my gut. A few moments later however, I found the reason. There had been a wreck and the people were driving slow to help the other lane maneuver around. I felt a sense of shame for how quick I had been to anger and how justified I had felt that the world was doing me an injustice.\r\n<blockquote>James 1:19-20 \"My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry, because human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.\"</blockquote>\r\nMost of the time, like the situation I faced today, we have not understood a situation correctly. In this life, we don't have perfect communication like we will in heaven. We often misread situations, people, intentions, motives, etc... I find that if I delay my anger and take time to properly understand the situation, I respond more appropriately to what's really happening. That's why it's good to be slow to anger. Because our anger is not just usually, it is selfish and it doesn't promote the righteousness God desires. And when we are dealing with fights, why do we use harsh words to correct innocent mistakes? Those arguments grow and grow until both parties are making fools of themselves and not displaying God's love for each other. If we want to win people over, let us be gentle, because a gentle man shows wisdom, maturity, and understanding.\r\n<blockquote>Proverbs 15:1 \"A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.\"</blockquote>\r\nTake time to try to see an debate from the other's perspective. If you want them to consider your case, you need to respect their case as well.\r\n<blockquote>Proverbs 25:15 \"Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone.\"</blockquote>\r\nSometimes people will say things that I could take offense at or correct. Someone will not be very polite, say an insult, or say something disrespectful to my reputation. Sometimes, I don't even bother to correct them, even when it's obvious they are wrong, because that speaks more about your character than trying to defend against every negative thing said against you. The truth is, everyone has negative qualities about them that we choose to overlook in grace. This means, that even if someone is correctly insulting you, it does not mean it is right. If God shows us grace, we are obligated to show grace to others. I simply see it as it is, ignorance and I let it slide by.\r\n<blockquote>Proverbs 12:16 \"Fools show their annoyance at once, but the prudent overlook an insult.\"\r\n\r\n2 Timothy 2:4 \"No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer.\"</blockquote>\r\nInstead of getting involved in useless quarrels, let's live our lives to please God and show grace and patience to one another. God gives us abounding grace, he chooses to overlook our offenses, separate our sins from us as far as the east is from the west and instead showers us with love and favor. As God's people who are called reveal God's ways to this earth, let's live lives worthy of the grace God shows us. Let us be slow to anger, peaceable, gentle at all times, and patient.",

          "content:encoded": "<blockquote>Romans 5:1-2 Therefore, since we are justified (acquitted, declared righteous, and given a right standing with God) through faith, let us [grasp the fact that we] have [the peace of reconciliation to hold and to enjoy] peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One). Through Him also we have [our] access (entrance, introduction) by faith into this grace (state of God’s favor) in which we [firmly and safely] stand. And let us rejoice <i>and</i> exult in our hope of experiencing <i>and</i> enjoying the glory of God.</blockquote>\r\nBecause of Adam's fall, man was separated from God. Abraham and his descendants were the means by which God planned to set the world to rights and deal with the problem of sin and the Israelites were given the law as the means by which they would fulfill that calling. However, what Paul tells us in beginning chapters of Romans is that just as the pagan world is part of the sin problem, so the Jews themselves who had been given this royal calling were part of the problem. In fact, the law did not help to fix the problem of sin, it in fact revealed it and made it worse. But God who is faithful to his promise to redeem the world sent Jesus, a descendant of Abraham to deal with the problem of sin once and for all and to restore creation back to fellowship with God and to everything that Adam had lost.\r\n\r\nWe who believe in Christ have become members of that covenant. It is not through our law keeping that we are identified as members of this divine covenant, but rather it is our faith that makes us partakers in this great promise which God has made. After-all, Abraham was not declared righteous after he was circumcised but rather before, when he believed God. Showing that he is the father of those who have faith and the father of those who are circumcised. And if Abraham is our father according to the Spirit, then we have become heirs of the promise, covenant members, and given righteousness and reconciliation.\r\n\r\nI want to focus on the message of reconciliation because if we understand this message, we will be able to grasp God's love for us and live as people who are free, alive, and right with God.\r\n<blockquote>Philippines 4:7 \"And God’s peace [shall be yours, that tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ, and so fearing nothing from God and being content with its earthly lot of whatever sort that is, that peace] which transcends all understanding shall garrison <i>and</i> mount guard over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.\"\r\n\r\nEphesians 1:2 \"May grace (God’s unmerited favor) and spiritual peace [which means peace with God and harmony, unity, and undisturbedness] be yours from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\n1 John 4:18 \"Such love has no fear, because perfect love expels all fear. If we are afraid, it is for fear of punishment, and this shows that we have not fully experienced his perfect love.\"</blockquote>\r\nWould it not be an awful tragedy to be completely reconciled to God in peace and yet not experience that peace? Instead of feeling safe, loved, and provided for by God, we instead feel doubtful, wondering, insecure, and afraid? Perhaps some of you feel this way. Let me ask, if you have to relate your relationship with God on a scale of 1-10 where would you be?\r\n\r\nHow is it then that we are given such clear verses about our standing before God, yet we still sometimes feel like God is distant or is holding something against us? My friends, we have not been taught to have confidence in what God has done for us. Instead we often place our trust in our flesh (that is our human effort) as the means by which we feel ok with God. When we have done well, we feel assured that we are ok with him, and when we have done wrong, or wrong a decent number of times, we begin to doubt our position in Christ.\r\n\r\nNow it is very true that God is pleased when we live upright lives that reflect his nature, but does God want us to doubt his character and oath every time we mess up? We are given this promise of assurance and God wants us to live and walk in the full understanding and hope of that assurance.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10:19-23 And so, dear brothers and sisters, we can boldly enter heaven’s Most Holy Place because of the blood of Jesus. By his death, Jesus opened a new and life-giving way through the curtain into the Most Holy Place. And since we have a great High Priest who rules over God’s house, let us go right into the presence of God with sincere hearts fully trusting him. For our guilty consciences have been sprinkled with Christ’s blood to make us clean, and our bodies have been washed with pure water. Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm, for God can be trusted to keep his promise.\r\n\r\nHebrews 6:17-19 God also bound himself with an oath, so that those who received the promise could be perfectly sure that he would never change his mind. So God has given both his promise and his oath. These two things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can have great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us. This hope is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads us through the curtain into God’s inner sanctuary.\r\n\r\nHebrews 7:18-19 \"Yes, the old requirement about the priesthood was set aside because it was weak and useless. For the law never made anything perfect. But now we have confidence in a better hope, through which we draw near to God.\"</blockquote>\r\nThis walk we have with God sometimes reminds me of the story of Adam. When Adam ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he recognized sin and found himself to be guilty. (This is an archetype of the law. For the law was put into purpose to expose sin and reveal that we are sinners.) The fruit promised wisdom, but it's end was sin-consciousness and curse. Likewise the law is good and shows us what God wants, yet those who eat of it, find themselves miserable in sin-consciousness and no better for it. The result was the curse that came on those who were disobedient (which Christ has redeemed us from).\r\n\r\nBut what did that sin-consciousness make Adam do? He hid from God. And God called and said, \"Who told you you were naked?\"\r\n\r\nWhen we have a legalistic mentality, that is we base our standing with God off of our human effort, instead of having peace, our minds are steeped in sin-consciousness. And this sin consciousness steals from the peace we are supposed to have with God. Instead of running to him in time of need, we hide from him. Instead of enjoying and embracing this reconciliation we have with Christ, we live as though our sin still separated ourselves from him. My friends, we must take our eyes off of ourselves and set them on Christ.\r\n<blockquote>1 John 3:18-22 Even if we feel guilty, God is greater than our feelings, and he knows everything. Dear friends, if we don’t feel guilty, we can come to God with bold confidence. And we will receive from him whatever we ask because we obey him and do the things that please him.\r\n\r\n2 Corinthians 5:16-21 So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. 21 God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\r\n\r\nColossians 3:15 \"15 And let the peace (soul harmony which comes) from Christ rule (act as umpire continually) in your hearts [deciding and settling with finality all questions that arise in your minds, in that peaceful state] to which as [members of Christ’s] one body you were also called [to live]. And be thankful (appreciative), [giving praise to God always].\"</blockquote>\r\nThis peace leads to a godly lifestyle, one that God is pleased with. For our good deeds flow out of peace. It causes us to yearn to please our Father, in the same way that we have fallen in love with him for the great affection he shows us. It is vitally important that we embrace this peace we have with God if we are to live our lives to please him.\r\n<blockquote>2 Corinthians 3:-18 The old way, with laws etched in stone, led to death, though it began with such glory that the people of Israel could not bear to look at Moses’ face. For his face shone with the glory of God, even though the brightness was already fading away. Shouldn’t we expect far greater glory under the new way, now that the Holy Spirit is giving life? If the old way, which brings condemnation, was glorious, how much more glorious is the new way, which makes us right with God! In fact, that first glory was not glorious at all compared with the overwhelming glory of the new way. So if the old way, which has been replaced, was glorious, how much more glorious is the new, which remains forever! Since this new way gives us such confidence, we can be very bold. We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so the people of Israel would not see the glory, even though it was destined to fade away. But the people’s minds were hardened, and to this day whenever the old covenant is being read, the same veil covers their minds so they cannot understand the truth. And this veil can be removed only by believing in Christ. Yes, even today when they read Moses’ writings, their hearts are covered with that veil, and they do not understand. But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. For the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. So all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the Lord. And the Lord—who is the Spirit—makes us more and more like him as we are changed into his glorious image.</blockquote>\r\nLet us be careful then not to miss the peace we have with God. Whenever we listen to sermons or teachings we need to test the fruit of that teaching. Does it serve to give you peace with God, confidence before him, and gratitude in your heart for his love? Or does it create doubt, separation, sin-consciousness, and fear of God? So then as you go about your life, pay attention to the things you believe. Notice how it makes your heart feel. And if your heart does not have that confidence before God, God is greater than our hearts and he will lead us into peace.",

          "content:encoded": "One of the discoveries I've been privileged to learn over the past few years is how relatable God is. In my younger years when I wasn't as familiar with Him, I would relate to Him as if he were an intense legal system. When I would pray, I was convinced that he would hear me if I prayed in a certain way, or enough times. I figured I had to speak to him in a certain way. I would never dare be angry with him or try to discuss my life's problems. After all, I didn't want him to know I had them. And when I would talk with the Lord, I figured there were many things I had to be doing right for him to respond or for me to hear. I only expected God to speak when it was really important.\r\n\r\nHowever, in these last few years of many conversations I have began to evolve the way I relate to him.\r\n\r\nI've discovered a simple truth.\r\n\r\nGod is a person.\r\n\r\nYou are not talking to someone that cannot be moved with sympathy. You are not talking to someone who is very particular about how you pray. You are not talking to a judge who cannot understand your problems or anger. He wants to be your friend, companion, guide, father, and God.\r\n\r\nThis means you can talk to him about anything, and he relates to you in the way you need best. I heard one sermon say, if you can't hear God it's because God wants you to hear him a different way. I did go through phases where it was hard to hear God and finally I asked, \"God when you change the way you speak to me will you go ahead and warn me that your switching? Like just simply tell me you want to speak to me a different way and not leave me in confusion?\"\r\n\r\nOf course, I found out later that is not how God works. He speaks to you in the way you are most comfortable hearing him or the way you want most (although I haven't heard him audibly that often). Sometimes though we have funny beliefs that convince us we can't hear him and those cause us to feel like God isn't speaking.\r\n\r\nSometimes we are so used to relating to God as a legalistic, un-relatable system that we make God... well... really weird. We don't know how to speak his language. And the truth is, you don't necessarily have to learn his language because he knows yours. He understands you better than you know yourself. I used to think all my prayers had to be audible for God to hear them. Now the majority of my prayers are in my mind or heart and God listens and answers them. It's really surprised me how friendly he is. If you are in a goofy mood, the Lord will joke with you. If you are having a hard time, the Lord will listen and comfort you. It even surprises me how casual and easy-going he can be. What?! God easygoing? He'll ask me how my day was or talk to me about things that interest me. Yet almost all of his conversations have an epic nature to them. They are full of wisdom and peace. They reveal his goodness and help me understand myself as well.\r\n\r\nNow it may sound like I have been selfish or self-occupied. (God speaks my language, God talks about the things that interest me, etc...) Actually I didn't start off that way and I am not doing it out of self-occupation, I'm giving glory to God's love, nature, and kindness. I used to try so hard to learn his language, and I would always be asking God what he wanted. But I would say, \"God what do you want to talk about?\" And he would reply, \"You.\" I would say Lord what is my calling, and the Lord would say, \"What do you want to do?\" He showed me later that our callings begin in our hearts and desires inspired by the Holy Spirit. I would try to learn God's language and found that God wasn't too concerned about that, he already knew mine.\r\n\r\nI hope as you continue spending time with the Lord you find out his personal nature. This is not necessarily something a teacher can tell you, it's something you must discover for yourself.",

He talks about why we don't need to be treating God as a priority item on a list and instead as someone who is involved and interested in every aspect of our lives. I agree with him and would like to note, when we put God on a list then it means he is able to be brought down to a lower position, whereas when he is our life he can be glorified in everything. Here is a video lecture by him if you would rather listen than read.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://youtu.be/jQx1oCbNIFg\" href=\"http://youtu.be/jQx1oCbNIFg\" target=\"_blank\">http://youtu.be/jQx1oCbNIFg</a>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size:large;\">A Mistake You Don't Want to Make: Putting God First Place in Your Life</span></p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Let's not waste time but cut to the chase: <b>God does NOT want to be first place in your life!</b></p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Like every lie, it always sounds so deceptively correct.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">After all, it sounds like it should be a “good Christian” thing to do right? If God is first place in your life then you're doing something right - you're putting Him above all else.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">He is first, then your family, then work, then everything else - sounds correct, right? Wrong!</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">It puts God on a list, and that's insulting to Him!</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Bad advice</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Well meaning people have told me: “<i>Bas, there are many things that clamor for your attention and devotion: your job, spouse, hobby - the demands and distractions of life. You need to be careful not to let other things become more important or more of a priority than your relationship with God. </i><i><b>Make sure you keep God first place in your life!</b></i><i>” </i></p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">At the time I thought this was wisdom speaking. Therefore, I swallowed it hook, line and sinker, not knowing I was being kidnapped by high sounding nonsense! Like every lie I've believed, it kept me in bondage.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">What people mean by “putting God first place” is that you need to prioritize Bible reading, prayer, and other “spiritual activities” above everything else. The implication, however, is that everything else is “worldly” and therefore not as good as the “spiritual” things.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">This mindset says there is a division between the sacred and the secular; a distinction is made between what is spiritual and what is worldly. According to this mindset your priority list would look like this (the line indicates the distinction):</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://revelationsingrace.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/make-sure-you-do-not-put-god-first-place.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1099\" alt=\"To Do List\" src=\"http://revelationsingrace.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/make-sure-you-do-not-put-god-first-place.png?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>1. God (Sacred/Spiritual)</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">-------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">2. Family (Secular/Worldly)</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">3. Work</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">4. Hobby</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">No distinction</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">In the sacred or spiritual category are things like worship, church attendance, prayer, Bible reading, evangelism, tithing, speaking in tongues, volunteering and obedience. And what is secular or “worldly”? Everything else, which includes basically 95% of where ordinary people - like you and me - spend their lives and energy: family, friends, work, hobbies, and interests.</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To put it bluntly: <b>this distinction is unbiblical! </b></p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">To make a distinction between spiritual and worldly is false and reveals a deep misunderstanding of the nature of a Christian. What makes something “spiritual” is not the<i> nature of an activity</i> but the <i> nature of the person</i>.</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">You <i>are</i> a spirit who <i>has</i> a soul and <i>lives</i> in a body. Because you are a spirit being, everything you do is “spiritual.” The <i>who</i> determines the <i>do</i>.</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Since you <i>are </i>a spiritual being who <i>lives</i> in a human body everything you do is 100% spiritual and 100 % natural. There isn't a single activity you do today that isn't spiritual.</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><b>Every action is spiritual because you are a spiritual being</b>.</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">So the next time you put your hands to work, change diapers (that's the stage I'm in with our daughter Anouk), enjoy your hobby, sip away your favorite drink, play games - remember that all those physical activities are <i>just as spiritual</i><b> </b><i>as</i> praying, Bible reading, worship, evangelism, etc.!</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<i>You are not a human being having a spiritual experience. You are a spiritual being having a human experience</i>.” – Pierre Teilhard de Chardin</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">In other words, you are not a human being on a spiritual journey. You are a spiritual being on a human journey.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">One simple truth</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Now we come to the one simple truth that can radically change your life and bring freedom.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Colossians 3:3-4 gives us clarity as to why you shouldn't put God first place in your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<i>Your old life is dead. Your new life, which is your real life - even though invisible to spectators - is with Christ in God. </i><i><b>He is your life</b></i>” (Amp.).</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Notice, it doesn’t say Christ is just <i>in</i> your life, but that Christ <i>is</i> your life. Christ defines your identity. He is the very essence of you, in you. He is the substance of everything about you.</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">If Christ is your life, then you can't put Him first place - or second, or third for that matter.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><b>He can only be one thing - your life, expressed through you each day!</b></p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">So even though this advice to keep God first place in your life <i>sounds</i> good, it's nothing but a lie.</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Instead of legalistically trying to keep God first place in your life I invite you to come of the religious treadmill to rest in the fact that Christ is your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>“<i>For in Him we live and move and have our being</i>.” (Acts 17:28)</blockquote>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">New Priority List</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Your “priority list” should actually look like this:</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">1. Christ is your life - in your family</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">1. Christ is your life - in your work</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">1. Christ is your life - in worship, prayer, Bible reading, church attendance.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">1. Christ is your life - in your hobbies and interests</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">1. Christ is your life - in your parenting, coffee drinking, joking around and bathroom breaks...</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Notice, Christ is always number 1! Why? Because He is your life! Since Christ is your life you can not put Him first place in your life. He is the substance of who you are! He is your identity.</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Christ is in you, with you, joined to you, and present in all aspects of your life. He's everything to you: “<i>To me, to live is Christ and to die is gain</i>”<i> </i>(Phil. 1:21). Notice Paul doesn't say that Christ is important to him. He says that “<i>to live is Christ</i>.” Paul is not trying to give Christ a proper place among other things. Instead, he is recognizing the fact that Christ is everything to him.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">There's no sense in comparing Jesus with other things and ranking Him as number one. He isn't separate from all other activities; He is intimately involved in every part and moment of your life because He lives in you, as you. The question is: are you aware of His indwelling presence?</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">God becomes less boring and religious and things become a lot more fun when you don't separate activities between “spiritual” and “worldly” but have a holistic view that says, “everything I do is fully spiritual and fully natural.”</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Permanent encounter</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">My life transformed when I realized God was always with me and that I'm meant to “encounter” God in everything I do. When I <i>believed</i> this, I started to <i>experience</i> it. In everything and everywhere, I am with Jesus and am able to experience Him. When I walk, talk, work, eat, play and go to the toilet.</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<i>Outside of Christ, I would seek to encounter God. In Christ, I am in a permanent encounter with God. Therefore, I am not seeking for the encounter of a life-time; I am in a lifetime of encounter!</i>”</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Encountering” God used to be something I tried to make happen through my “spiritual” disciplines or activities like praying, Bible reading and singing worship songs. But it became effortless when I started to believe that I am already in a lifetime of encounter.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">The practice of “spiritual” activities are no longer special or more spiritual than the other things I do. All activities during the day are an invitation to hang out with Jesus, talk to Him, listen to Him and do life together.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Abundant life</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">In the midst of your busy life as you juggle many activities like family time, church activities, sports, Bible study times, housekeeping, reading books, time with friends, do emails, etc., sometimes you might wonder... “How can I spend more time with God?”</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">You end up trying to fit God in your daily routine and family life and in the end you feel frustrated and guilty because you think God isn't enough of a priority in your life.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">If you are still trying to make God a central part of your life - adding Him into your daily schedule or routine, trying to do the “right” things to please Him - it's about time you realize He's already made you a central part of His life!</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Because you are a central part of His life, it's impossible to make Him first place in your life.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Certainly there are many thing that clamor for our attention. And yes, demands and distractions in our lives are real. But unlike the religious advice I received, I don't have to worry about letting other things become more important or more of a priority than my relationship with God because I'm incapable and not called to keep God first place in my life – I'm free of that lie.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">That doesn't mean I don't cultivate my relationship with God. I do. I talk with God, listen and actively fellowship with Him - both when having time alone and throughout the day - in order to discover more of Him and experience abundant life.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Of course you can draw aside to be quiet whenever you want, but let's discover the joy of Abba's companionship in every detail of life. The more you grow conscious of how He is with you all the time the more you'll experience a living breathing relationship with God no matter what you do.</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Thus, the key to experience God's abundant life - His love, joy, peace, power, etc. - is <i>not</i> by legalistically trying to give God enough of a priority in the context of your busy life as if He can be put number one on your priority list.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">To experience abundant life and walk in fullness of love and power is to continue to renew your mind and stay aware of God's indwelling presence and His love for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">As Romans 6:8 says, “To be Spirit-minded is life and peace.” In other words, choose to stay conscious of His joyous presence and you'll get wrecked by His supernatural love, joy and peace.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">As you depend on Him, you can't help but experience and manifest the Person that's living inside of you.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><b>Your Grace walk isn't about trying to keep God first place in your life, but about God expressing Himself through you wherever you are and with whomever you are.</b></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">Enjoy not putting God first place in your life, but the resting in Who He is and who you are in Him and the effortless bearing of fruit as a result.</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"http://revelationsingrace.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/make-grace-your-way-of-life.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1098\" alt=\"Make Grace Your Way of Life\" src=\"http://revelationsingrace.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/make-grace-your-way-of-life.jpg?w=300\" width=\"300\" height=\"111\" /></a></p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">-----</p>\r\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Short Bio:</p>\r\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Bas is a husband to Michelle and Dad to Anouk.

              "wp:comment_content": "The problem with this \"putting God first\" motto is that most people don't even know what they're doing. Subconsciously it could mean anything to them anywhere from \"spiritual activities\" or \"all out preaching\" or otherwise just regurgitating the motto and thinking they mean something.\r\n The problem with spiritual activities is that I'd readily concede they work if they served some kind of good purpose. But what exactly is being spiritual? Regurgitating gospel music which you secretly know sucks because the creators are too lazy going beyond the classic 4 chords? Pouring some oil or otherwise stretching a few key points into a sermon which would otherwise fit in a 5 minute article? Or otherwise actually \"increasing\" faith by meditating on the scriptures or trolling at Jesus Daily saying \"I trust him 100%\" because everyone else there says so? They've gotta be kidding. By all means, be \"spiritual\" and try to increase one's faith and tell others to be spiritual when one's own spirituality actually works. When it comes to declaring faith for healing they're all hyped up and start lecturing others. When it comes to an eye exam tomorrow you see them running to their optometrists-not God. When it comes to jobs and academics they start chanting \"God is with me\". When someone actually challenges them to a bet God is now ten thousand miles away and spiritual warfare becomes \"I was just speculating and practicing my faith\". They meditate on the verse \"who can be against me\" and then get smashed by their enemies, notwithstanding \"turn the other cheek\" is often used in conjunction with situations where they have no hand to strike back. They can't really do much good deeds themselves so they have to fuel their pride by pretending they're \"separate from the world\" by selectively picking out atheists with faults that even most atheists themselves detest.\r\n\r\nIf they mean putting God first as a measure of deeds, it's all talk and no deeds. I wonder what they have been doing while I have been chilling out and driving demons. Less stressful than weekly lectures at the church, but probably more productive. I wonder what notable deeds the average Christian, or even the vast majority of Christians, have done amidst this talking . Evangelist trips? They're mostly camps organized by a local church and if that money donated straight to a ministry it would have far more effect. I dare them to stay in Africa for over 3 weeks and they'll feel the pain. Tithing? A few dollars here and there-even I have done more. My friend saved $70000 because I stepped in the right time with the right strategic advice when others told him otherwise. Christian spiritualists? I doubt most of them have contributed over $7000 to a cause. Then comes the hardcores who are quick to say \"have the peace of God-you'll need it in the tribulation\". I wonder why people in their congregations don't flinch when Billy Crone preaches that sort of stuff. You'd think if we were left behind for the tribulation congregations who believe that doctrine should start fretting and assessing themselves on whether they could stand even the torment of a single scorpion released by Satan without being doomed by God from putting on the Mark of the Beast, but apparently it's one ear in and one ear out-avoid the problems and regurgitate the message-from the sublime to the ridiculous-and in that you get \"putting God first\". \r\n\r\nThen there's the third bunch that talks about \"putting God first\" while not actually knowing what they want to achieve by that, what they have achieved by that, or what they plan to achieve by that. Does it mean spending time with God? Funny most of them complain about you not talking to God while they are the ones who most frequently preach that man can't speak to God these days. Fancy having a convo with a corpse for over 5 minutes. Let me see them manage that and I'll accept their criticism of not spending enough time with God, and this is supposing I had not learnt to prophecy yet. Does it mean going all out with evangelism? Sure, I don't mind that. But I do have a problem with people pretending to give up time for God when they have a wife, kids to feed etc. By all means, don't get married or have kids if you're going all out 24/7. \r\n\r\nThe problem with \"putting God first\" is that nobody really knows what they're doing. The Christian music industry thinks it's done by putting \"grace\" \"king\" \"cross\" and \"thornes\" on every song-and they wonder why their tunes are so restricted and why Skillet is so successful without that strategy. And indeed nobody was surprised when artists who got famous self-admittedly regurgitated old songs into the 4 chords and received abundant sales from the Christian music industry. The Bible readers-I'm actually quite lenient-I don't even expect them to carry out what's written in the Bible. I just expect them to at least be able to explain what they're reading if they're going to lecture others on reading the book. You see these dudes going on about the OT and NT studying the book like they're taking a course for ancient history, while not being able to explain why any of those events are of relevance to today's world or otherwise why Jesus randomly says things like \"don't throw pearls to the pigs\". And oh dear, when you see those guys saying \"I have not encountered a single pair of seemingly contradictory verses\" then you see a robot who is bent on memorizing verses but has no capacity for thinking. For the law adherents it's about pretending to go all out for deeds that you don't have-the hardcore life is \"just around the corner\"-they all say-but hardly any of the talkers ever get to it. For the grace adherents it usually means pretending God did everything while you worked yourself like a slave, or pretending that you've \"overcome\" when in reality you've just got owned by trouble and barely managed to come out alive. \r\n\r\nThe existential problem here is not even so much that people should devote their lives to God as the fact that it's linguistically obfuscating-it's the fact that for 99% of typical Christians who just know they will not have the motivation to go all out and preach in a third world nation or otherwise donate all their money to the poor (especially in a historical time when most people are married nowadays), none of them ever cares to think what other options they have or what they plan on doing that could be classified as \"hardcore\" apart from those two options. They know full well that those two choices are out of reach and yet they still like to daydream about an ambiguous \"put God first\" life in which they themselves don't even know what they should be doing. As if that's not enough, they avoid the problems and preach this ambiguous life to others and encourage others to be intellectually ambiguous.",

          "content:encoded": "You've just made some cookies and your young child is wanting with all his little heart to eat too many. As a parent, would it be more productive to set that plate on the table in front of him, tell your child not to eat any and walk away, or would you set the cookies somewhere out of sight?\r\n\r\nTemptation. What a sensitive topic for us, and I'm no master on it myself. No sooner will I say I have been doing well and having a good streak than I will be given into it the next day. It frustrates us the most, because it denies our will and shows how out of control we are. But we are not alone, every man in the world including the great apostles fell into it.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 7 \" 14 For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of flesh, sold into bondage to sin. 15 For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I <i>would</i> like to <i>do</i>, but I am doing the very thing I hate. 16 But if I do the very thing I do not want <i>to do</i>, I agree with the Law, <i>confessing</i> that the Law is good. 17 <strong>So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me</strong>. 18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good <i>is</i> not. 19 For the good that I want, I do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. 20 But if I am doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me. 21 I find then the principle that evil is present in me, the one who wants to do good. 22 For I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man, 23 but I see a different law in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin which is in my members. 24 Wretched man that I am! Who will set me free from the body of this death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhen we face a temptation, the first thing we are tempted to do is to throw up a list of rules of \"thou shalt not's\". We remind ourselves of why that sin is wrong and how destructive it is. The sad part about humanness is however, that your lusts don't always listen to reason or the wrongness of a thing.\r\n\r\nThis is the situation Paul finds himself in. He has the law right beside him telling him that the very thing he is doing is wrong, but it is not lifting a finger to help him overcome it. This clearly shows us the limitation of the law or that list of \"I really should not be doing this.\" They are true, but they honestly don't help.\r\n<blockquote>Colossians 2:23 \"These rules may seem wise because they require strong devotion, pious self-denial, and severe bodily discipline. But they provide no help in conquering a person's evil desires.\"</blockquote>\r\nSo what does that leave us with? If the knowledge of good and evil cannot help us overcome evil, then how will we escape sin?\r\n\r\nPaul gives us the solution in the next verse.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 8 \"<strong>Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus</strong>. 2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and of death. 3 For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God <i>did</i>: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and <i>as an offering</i> for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, 4 so that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe solution is grace. When we are dealing with sinful habits, we need to treat the root of the plant and not just the fruit. You can battle the fruit all day, but unless you revive the root, it will keep producing the same kind of fruit. The root is producing wrong fruit, because of a lack of grace. Let me explain with a passage from Luke.\r\n<blockquote>Luke 7:36-48 \"When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”\r\n\r\nJesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, teacher,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”\r\n\r\nSimon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.”\r\n\r\n“You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.\r\n\r\nThen he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet. Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.”\r\n\r\nThen Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”</blockquote>\r\nWhen you have done wrong and given into that temptation you didn't want to, you expect judgement and condemnation. But if instead of receiving that, you are shown a richer mercy than you would have ever imagined, if you were shown blessing instead of curse, there is something very deep and transforming that happens in your heart. It happens when you realize that your forgiveness didn't come for free, Christ had to be brutally killed for you to have it. Your heart suddenly becomes in awe of God (the fear of God) and worships him. Your heart becomes... grateful. It looses interest in that temptation and suddenly wants to live in a way that honors the love you are shown. All of a sudden your eyes are no longer focused on your sin and instead are looking at Jesus and his magnificent love for you. And when your eyes are no longer on your sin, it cannot continue to tempt you.\r\n\r\nThis brings us back to the story of the cookies. Sin has the strongest effect when you have your eyes set on it. If all you can think about is, \"I'm an awful sinner. Lusting is so evil. Lusting is evil. Lusting is evil. I should never do it. I should feel so bad for lusting, etc...\" all you are doing is setting your focus on that sin. And in your misery, that sin has the opportunity to pounce on you again.\r\n\r\nWe need to put that sin out of our sight.\r\n\r\nInstead of focusing on how wrong a sin is, how bad we are, how condemned we should feel we need to focus on how amazing God's grace is for that situation, how much love he shows us.\r\n\r\nOne of the ways sin becomes powerful is when we let it identify us. When I look at myself and evaluate myself according to my sin, I am letting sin become my master. We must realize that we are no longer identified in Adam, we are identified in Christ. We are justified, holy, and blameless. We are a new creation and we have a new nature. That is no longer who we are and that is not what we do. We must identify ourselves as righteous, holy, and blameless before God. Because our actions are tied to what we think of ourselves. As long as we identify ourselves as a sinner, guess what, we will continue to act like one.\r\n\r\nHave you ever watched White Collar? It's a wonderful story of a criminal who after being caught, lands a job with the FBI catching other criminals instead of serving prison time. His mentor Peter Burke becomes like a father figure to him. However, Neal (the criminal) continues to commit crimes behind the FBI's back because that's all he knows how to do. In one episode Peter asks Neal about his past and father. Neal says his dad was a dirty cop. Peter does something very special in that moment, he says, \"You're not your dad.\" From that moment on in the seasons you see Neal's attitude towards crime changing. He no longer wants to be the way he used to, he begins to loose his interest in crime and wants to be a man of integrity.\r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't stay that way, as good shows usually don't. Later Neal gets trapped in a situation where he must commit a crime to save someone he loves. Peter catches him but he gives some harsh words. \"That's because that's all you know. You're a criminal, how could I expect any more.\" Neal was convicted. Shortly after you see Neal regain his passion for crime and begin plotting a way to escape the FBI.\r\n\r\nNeal was driven by identity.\r\n\r\nWe all are. Who we think we are plays a big role in how we behave. As long as you let sin tell you who you are, you have let it become your master. You must silence the voice of the accuser and listen to the voice of Christ, the voice of Grace.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 6:14 \"Sin is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the requirements of the law. Instead, you live under the freedom of God's grace.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe Apostle Peter says it this way.\r\n<blockquote>2 Peter 1:4-8 \"And because of his glory and excellence, he has given us great and precious promises. These are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and escape the world’s corruption caused by human desires... (Here he lists many wonderful character and faith qualities, then he says)... <strong>But those who fail to develop in this way are shortsighted or blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their old sins.</strong></blockquote>\r\nForgiveness is the foundation that changes your heart and fills you with gratitude, which is the motivation you need to overcome sin. When you get to enjoy a new identity, a grace that never stops covering you, and God's infinite patience, you have the power you need to overcome that temptation.\r\n<blockquote>Titus 2:11-12 \"For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age\"\r\n\r\n1 Corinthians 15:10 \"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them--yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.\"</blockquote>\r\nIt's kind of funny and the opposite of what you would expect. But when I'm going through my daily life, when I encounter a temptation, I tell myself. \"Thank you God, if I were to do that thing, I would be shown your grace. I ask for a fresh revelation of that grace in order to keep that from being a temptation for me.\" All of a sudden what happens in my heart is it becomes amazed at God's kindness, it relaxes with peace, and my eyes are no longer on that temptation. Instead I have gratitude that keeps me content and the temptation passes by. Now that may not work the same for you, but the principle is still the same.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm dealing with a repetitive sin, the first thing I do... and the first thing that should be done, is pray to God to fix that problem. Instead of dealing with it in your own limited strength, place it into God's hands and let him through his Spirit conquer those temptations for you. Don't try to fight alone, you need God's help. Then trust and wait for God's deliverance and while you wait continuously give yourself the grace you need.\r\n\r\nGit rid of the source of the temptation whenever you can. If your friends are leading you into doing drugs, don't hang out with them anymore. If people are influencing you in a bad way leave them.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 15:33 \"Do not be misled: \"Bad company corrupts good character.\"</blockquote>\r\nYou are not judging your friends or saying God can't love them by leaving them. You are wisely and appropriately removing yourself from the temptation and that is godly.\r\n\r\nIf the computer is tempting you, install <a title=\"http://www1.k9webprotection.com/\" href=\"http://www1.k9webprotection.com/\" target=\"_blank\">K9</a> and/or <a title=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom?hl=en\" href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Adblock</a> or some other filtering and blocking software to keep you from having full access. Don't let the temptation have free reign right in front of you.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 6:18 \"18 <strong>Flee</strong> from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.\"</blockquote>\r\nWhy would he use such a strong word, \"flee\". Why not \"ignore temptation\"? Why not avoid? Why not walk away? He uses flee because as long as that temptation is in front of you it WILL win. In that case, it doesn't matter how much grace you have, how well you identify yourself, if you set sexual temptation in front of you continually and keep it in focus it will win. You cannot battle it. Flee. Raise the retreat flag. The same principle applies to other sins to a lesser degree, don't let them consume your focus, emotions, and mind. Look to Christ for grace and keep your eyes on the one who will still love you, especially when you fail!\r\n<blockquote>Romans 5:20 \"God's law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God's wonderful grace became more abundant.\"</blockquote>",

          "content:encoded": "Philippians 4:6-7 <span id=\"en-NKJV-29449\" class=\"text Phil-4-6\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;</span><span id=\"en-NKJV-29450\" class=\"text Phil-4-7\" style=\"color:#000000;\"><span class=\"versenum\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\"> </span>and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</span>\r\n\r\nI was reading this verse on day a few years ago and it began to change the way I reacted to stressful situations. That change has only grown through the years and has now become a healthy lifestyle.\r\n\r\nWhen I read it, here's how I understood it. Whenever the opportunity arises to become anxious, instead of becoming worried, we should pray about what we would like the desired outcome to be, and then instead of worrying, trust in what God will do for that situation. I started practicing that whenever I noticed myself getting worried. I would be driving in the car, realize that my mind was stressed and in that moment, I would pray for the very thing I was worried for.\r\n\r\nMost often, God ends up answering the prayer and I later realize I had nothing to worry about. I think it's a much healthier way to handle situations to pray instead of worry. After-all, what can your worry do? If you are going to worry you might as well be productive and ask God for his help. Then He can actually be working in that situation. Not only that, but then your worry serves a purpose to get God involved. So when you worry, automatically think, pray.\r\n<blockquote>James 4:2 \"<span style=\"color:#000000;\">You lust and do not have; </span><i style=\"color:#000000;\">so</i><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> you </span><span style=\"color:#000000;\">commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain; </span><i style=\"color:#000000;\">so</i><span style=\"color:#000000;\"> you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nI think we face many more troubles than we actually should because we forget to ask for God's help in that situation. The other day at school, I was trying to solve a problem in my web scripting and after two hours of trying everything imaginable to make it work, I gave up in disappointment and frustration. I was sad for a while, because I needed the program to work. In that moment, I noticed I was discouraged and asked God to fill me with his peace and joy again in order to move on. He said, \"Let's speak tonight and I will remove your frustration.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, I was about to talk with the Lord but had to go use the restroom first (isn't it always in the restroom when the Lord speaks). While I was in the restroom the Lord spoke to me and said, \"You were disappointed and frustrated because you didn't ask for my help. Next time you begin to feel that way and nothing is working, ask and then you won't be frustrated.\"\r\n\r\nInstantly I felt relief, usually I do pray but that time I had forgotten. That night I asked for his help and in about 7 minutes the problem I had been trying to fix that day was completely solved.\r\n\r\nThe next time this situation came up I remembered what the Lord had said. For some reason a piece of code was working perfectly in one site, but in another site it was not. I ran though the checklist of steps, making sure everything was setup properly and running smoothly. I tried dozens of changes and eventually made an entirely new web page. But the program still did not work. When I noticed myself getting frustrated I remembered to ask God for his help. A few moments later, a strange idea came to mind that was completely random and very unrelated to the problem. The problem was so random I could have never guessed what it was and that's how I know the Lord gave it too me. I tried out the idea and the problem was solved, just moments after I prayed.\r\n\r\nSo let God get involved in the small details of your life, whether it's needing an important phone call to be answered, or dealing with a frustration in your job, taking a test for school, or having a relationship difficulty, use your worry as an opportunity to invite God into that situation and allow him to do what your worry can't.",

          "content:encoded": "If you have grown up in church, then at some point you were taught that God is sovereign and everything is under his control. And sometimes that makes us think that if God is in control and something bad happens, then it must be God's doing. He must have intended it and had a bigger plan with it.\r\n\r\nNow there is some truth in this view, that we take comfort in. This idea that God is going to do something special with the pain we suffer, that it will somehow be used for our and other people's good. And because we find that comfort in our pains, sometimes it's hard for us to let go of the belief that God did not create the pain to begin with.\r\n\r\nPlease understand if you have suffered through great hardship, I by no means want to circumvent or diminish the realness of your pain. I also have undergone great hardship and I know we need God's comfort in those situations. However, sometimes I've found that the way we view pain and God in those situations can actually make the pain worse than it really is. It can make us angry at God and confused, because we want to understand why He would do this to us. I want to preserve the truth of God's ultimate redemption of our pain while at the same time helping us not to see God as the bad guy and the good guy.\r\n<blockquote>Isaiah 54:14-15 \"<span style=\"color:#001320;\">In righteousness you will be established; You will be far from oppression, for you will not fear; And from terror, for it will not come near you. </span><span class=\"highl\" style=\"color:#001320;\">\"<strong>If anyone fiercely assails you it will not be from Me</strong>. Whoever assails you will fall because of you.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nWhat we see here is a picture of God. We understand that God is in control of everything, the new and old testament tell us so.\r\n<blockquote><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Psalm 22:28 For kingship belongs to the </span><span class=\"sc\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Lord</span><span style=\"color:#000000;\">, and he rules over the nations.</span></blockquote>\r\nHowever just like an earthly king, do all things happen according to that king's will? It is the king's job to rescue his people from plague, calamity, enemies, starvation, etc... But does this mean that the king is causing those things? He is in control of his empire, but he has enemies that resist his will.\r\n\r\nLikewise, God is King and he has a plan to set everything to rights and to work all things together for our good, but he does not initiate every bad thing that happens. There are calamities that happen apart from his will because we still live in a fallen world sometimes under the influence of the devil.\r\n<blockquote><strong style=\"color:#001320;\">If anyone fiercely assails you it will not be from Me...</strong></blockquote>\r\nIf everything happens because God wanted it to happen, then we would not just have to blame God for your troubles, but also for every evil thing in this world. Even Hitler and the Jew's persecution. Is this supposed to be comforting?\r\n\r\nIn some movies we see the villains creating a dangerous chemical weapon to spread around the city, and they are also inventing the cure so that when the chemical has been released, they will become rich on selling the vaccine. We know who these characters are in the story, they are the villains. Why do we think God does this?\r\n<blockquote>Psalm 34:15-22 \"The eyes of the <span class=\"name\">Lord</span> are on the righteous,\r\n<div class=\"stanza\" style=\"color:#001320;\">\r\n<p class=\"line2\">and his ears are attentive to their cry;</p>\r\n<p class=\"line1\">but the face of the <span class=\"name\">Lord</span> is against those who do evil,</p>\r\n<p class=\"line2\">to blot out their name from the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"stanza\" style=\"color:#001320;\">\r\n<p class=\"line1\">The righteous cry out, and the <span class=\"name\">Lord</span> hears them;</p>\r\n<p class=\"line2\">he delivers them from all their troubles.</p>\r\n<p class=\"line1\">The <span class=\"name\">Lord</span> is close to the brokenhearted</p>\r\n<p class=\"line2\">and saves those who are crushed in spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"stanza\" style=\"color:#001320;\">\r\n<p class=\"line1\"><strong>The righteous person may have many troubles,</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"line2\"><strong>but the <span class=\"name\">Lord</span> delivers him from them all;</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"line1\">he protects all his bones,</p>\r\n<p class=\"line2\">not one of them will be broken.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"stanza\" style=\"color:#001320;\">\r\n<p class=\"line1\">Evil will slay the wicked;</p>\r\n<p class=\"line2\">the foes of the righteous will be condemned.</p>\r\n<p class=\"line1\">The <span class=\"name\">Lord</span> will rescue his servants;</p>\r\n<p class=\"line2\">no one who takes refuge in him will be condemned.\"</p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"stanza\" style=\"color:#001320;\">\r\n<p class=\"line2\">Here we see a righteous man who faces troubles. Is God unjust? Did he create trouble for the righteous? Not at all. Rather, because these men live righteously in a fallen world, they face persecution and trouble and the Lord is there to rescue them. What we need to understand then is this... God is in control of all things, and ultimately his will will prevail in every situation, but he is not the author of evil. There is an enemy, and there is a fallen world that sometimes try to have their way.</p>\r\n<p class=\"line2\">I sometimes think of it like a chess game. The enemy makes his move and for a moment it looks like he's winning, but then God makes his move and makes the enemy's move backfire and become the very thing that causes him to loose the game.</p>\r\n<p class=\"line2\">When you face troubles, God doesn't just pat you on the back and say sorry that the world hurt you. He is actively working in those situations to redeem you, heal your pains, restore everything, and eventually turn those very things into your benefit and good later on. Sometimes he does such a good job of turning situations around for our good, it's hard to imagine that He did not create the pain to begin with.</p>\r\n<p class=\"line2\">So I think when we suffer, we should not wonder what God's will is in that situation or why he would cause it or let it happen. Instead we understand it for what it is, it's a trouble of this world, and God will redeem us from those situations and turn things around for our good.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>",

The enemy has a way of falling into the pit he digs for others. He cannot understand the wisdom of our Father,  but we can. We can know His will and not think He is putting us through some mysterious trial to \"teach us something\". We know Jesus IS His will and His plan is for all of us to manifest all of Him.",

That is a skill that must be developed by every writer and you are obviously honing in on your own flow.  The formatting is also very readable now…you've eliminated the ultra-lenthy paragraph which makes reading on a screen much easier.  Besides that, the content of this blog has a great and encouraging flow.  Thanks for taking the time to put this out there.  I am encouraged by you.\r\n-jared",

          "content:encoded": "I wanted to take a minute and advertise two figures who have been influencing my thinking on the gospels and Romans for the last few months.\r\n\r\nThe first is N. T. Wright, a well respected theologian whom some are calling the world's top scholar. He is the Bishop of Durham and has much experience in studying the new testament and the jewish culture of Jesus's day. His views on romans and the gospels have changed my concepts of \"the kingdom\" and the big picture in the Bible itself. His view on Romans I believe is more complete and makes much more sense than views that I had previously held especially concerning the word righteousness and how it is intended to be used throughout Romans. I enjoy listening to him a lot because he seems very objective in his views. He works hard to prevent his own nurture and biases from affecting the way he interprets scripture and constantly challenges his own views and other's views and is not afraid to ask difficult questions, although he says it is impossible to completely get away from one's bias.\r\n\r\nYou can purchase his book<a title=\"http://www.amazon.com/Paul-Everyone-Romans-Part-One/dp/0664227996\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Paul-Everyone-Romans-Part-One/dp/0664227996\"> <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Paul for Everyone: Romans, Part One</span></a> on Amazon. I have also included some of his free material here that has really inspired me. He is well educated and so sometimes his material may be difficult to read for the average reader, but his \"For Everyone\" book series is written to be simple.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://youtu.be/7glk-aSt-TM?t=5m29s\" href=\"http://youtu.be/7glk-aSt-TM?t=5m29s\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Wright's brief explanation of the word \"righteousness\" in Romans</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Jesus_Kingdom.mp3\" href=\"http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Jesus_Kingdom.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Jesus and the Kingdom</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Jesus_Cross.mp3\" href=\"http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Jesus_Cross.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Jesus and the Cross</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Jesus_God.mp3\" href=\"http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Jesus_God.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Jesus and God</a>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Jesus_Light.mp3\" href=\"http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Jesus_Light.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Jesus and the World's True Light</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe second scholar is <a title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bivin\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bivin\" target=\"_blank\">David Bivin</a>, a very well respected Jewish scholar living in Israel. His book <a title=\"http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Difficult-Words-Jesus-Perspective-ebook/dp/B0028N61V4/ref=la_B002BM23XC_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406786023&amp;sr=1-2\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Difficult-Words-Jesus-Perspective-ebook/dp/B0028N61V4/ref=la_B002BM23XC_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406786023&amp;sr=1-2\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus: New Insights from a Hebrew Perspective</a> has clarified a lot of foggy passages throughout Matthew such as Matthew 6:22 \"The eye is the lamp of the body If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light,\" Matthew 18:18 about binding and loosing in heaven and on earth, Matthew 5:17 about fulfilling and not destroying the law, and many others. The majority of the book is devoted to proving how Matthew was in fact originally written in Hebrew and not in Greek as many scholars in the last 250 years have claimed and that the language that was common to Jews in that day and the language Jesus would have spoken was Hebrew. This discovery has lead to the reinterpreting of several difficult passages that when put into Hebrew finally make sense. Jesus was often using Hebrew idioms in his speeches and this has lead to confusion in our english translations.\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXSbaGZqG8s\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXSbaGZqG8s\">Check out this quick video he made explaining Matthew 6:22.</a>\r\n\r\nI am not trying to sell content, I have been strongly impacted by these scholars and I feel they have greatly enriched my understanding of the Bible, the language, and the culture of that time. These men have done the hard work for studying the Bible in context, the language of that time, and the culture and we could greatly benefit if we pay attention.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

          "content:encoded": "Most of you are familiar with the parable in Matthew 18 about the unforgiving servant.\r\n<blockquote>Matthew 18:32-35 \"...<span id=\"en-NIV-23760\" class=\"text Matt-18-32\"><span class=\"woj\">Then the master called the servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said, ‘I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.</span></span> <span id=\"en-NIV-23761\" class=\"text Matt-18-33\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">33 </sup>Shouldn’t you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?’</span></span> <span id=\"en-NIV-23762\" class=\"text Matt-18-34\"><span class=\"woj\"><sup class=\"versenum\">34 </sup>In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed. </span></span>\r\n\r\nThis is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.\"</blockquote>\r\nThis passage becomes controversial when placed in a New Covenant context. The message of the New Covenant claims that we have been forgiven of all our sins past, present, and future. Our salvation is contingent on us being forgiven. We are righteous and justified. If we put this scripture into the new covenant, then it implies that if we are not merciful God can change his mind and hold our sins against us.\r\n\r\nBefore I go any further, I want to clarify that I am not advocating un-forgiveness. It goes against the fabric of everything that Jesus did for us. And even the new testament makes forgiveness a matter of importance.\r\n<blockquote>Colossians 3:13 \"Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.\"</blockquote>\r\nHowever, the difference between this passage and the other one at the beginning of this article is that the first leaves room to believe that you will cease to be forgiven if you do not forgive while the other implores you to out of respect and gratefulness but not with the threat of suddenly being unforgiven.\r\n\r\nLet's examine for a second that the first example is new covenant, that if we fail to forgive we won't be forgiven. What are the implications of this? Our relationship with God comes into question. We may no longer approach him with peace and confidence. We would no longer be called righteous and holy. The curses of disobedience would come upon us and a greater question arises: Could a person who is not forgiven go to heaven?\r\n\r\nYou may think these are silly implications, that it doesn't need to be taken that seriously. But I have meet a few people who were deeply worried they would not go to heaven for this reason. They prayed that God would not let them die before they could forgive everybody. They lived their lives in fear and worry. Are they being illogical? Or do we lesson the intensity to make it doable for christians. Christians still go to heaven and are called righteous, but God still sends curses on them in this life?\r\n<h2>Forgiveness for the unforgiving</h2>\r\nI initially though that the new testament didn't have much to clarify on this topic but it turns out it does in Romans 2. If we compare Paul's words to the words of Jesus we see that Paul is saying the same thing Jesus was.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 2:1-5 \"<span class=\"text Rom-2-1\">You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.</span><span id=\"en-NIV-27965\" class=\"text Rom-2-2\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup>Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-27966\" class=\"text Rom-2-3\">So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?</span><span id=\"en-NIV-27967\" class=\"text Rom-2-4\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup>Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance? </span>But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.\"</blockquote>\r\nNotice that Paul goes a little further than Jesus to explain what kind of punishment awaits those who do not forgive. It does not involve a curse from Deuteronomy but rather a storage of God's wrath against you on the day of judgement (a pretty chilling prospect).\r\n\r\n<strong>But what is the point Paul eventually makes with this? </strong>This is not the conclusion of his argument, but rather he is setting up a backstory on which to release the full power of the gospel. The backstory is that the gentile, who was sinful by nature, and the Jew who judges the sinful gentile were both guilty before God. In Romans 3 Paul wraps up his point, that everyone, including the judgmental have fallen into sin and are accountable to God, some, held there accused by the law. Is the command to forgive part of the law?\r\n<blockquote>Leviticus 19:18 \"Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD.\"</blockquote>\r\nJames uses this same law to convict his jewish audience\r\n<blockquote>James 2:8-10 \"<span id=\"en-NIV-30302\" class=\"text Jas-2-8\">If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-30303\" class=\"text Jas-2-9\">But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted <strong>by the law</strong> as lawbreakers. </span><span id=\"en-NIV-30304\" class=\"text Jas-2-10\">For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nIf you read through Romans you will find that Paul eventually comes back to the situation he wrote about in chapter 2.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 3:22-24 \"<span id=\"en-NIV-28014\" class=\"text Rom-3-22\">This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile,</span><span id=\"en-NIV-28015\" class=\"text Rom-3-23\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, </span><span id=\"en-NIV-28016\" class=\"text Rom-3-24\">and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nRomans 5 also opens with\r\n<blockquote>Romans 5:1-2 \"<span class=\"text Rom-5-1\">Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, </span><span id=\"en-NIV-28050\" class=\"text Rom-5-2\">through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nHow can we have peace with a God who is holding wrath for us on the final day of judgement? If this is not clear Paul spells it out for us later.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 5:9-10 \"<span id=\"en-NIV-28057\" class=\"text Rom-5-9\">Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God’s wrath through him!</span><span id=\"en-NIV-28058\" class=\"text Rom-5-10\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup>For if, while we were God’s enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!\"</span></blockquote>\r\nWhat wrath is he talking about? Is it not the same wrath spoken of in chapter 2?\r\n<blockquote>\"But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.\"</blockquote>\r\nYou see, Paul has not singled out un-forgiveness as the one sin that cannot be forgiven, rather he has included it in the list of every sin that would result in divine wrath and the list of sins we were all completely forgiven for in Christ. I dare say in Paul's mind un-forgiveness is just as forgivable as coveting.\r\n\r\nJames says the same thing.\r\n<blockquote>James 2:12-13 \"<span id=\"en-NIV-30306\" class=\"text Jas-2-12\">Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-30307\" class=\"text Jas-2-13\">because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nWhat is the law that gives freedom? Some people speculate it refers to the gift of no condemnation coming from the gospel.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 8:1-2 \"<span class=\"text Rom-8-1\">Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-28119\" class=\"text Rom-8-2\">because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you free from the law of sin and death.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nThis would be the law or \"principle\" that gives freedom, compared to the law in leviticus which gives death. So what is James point? Speak and act like people who are going to be judged by grace and not the law. How? By showing people the grace you yourselves are receiving. Why? Because under the law, judgement without mercy will be shown to everyone who is not merciful. But under grace, mercy triumphs over judgement.\r\n\r\nSo what does this mean to believers?\r\n\r\nGod still wants us to forgive, to forgive just as we have been forgiven. It is the proper and natural response to the amazing grace we have been shown. And though the new testament does encourage christians to forgive in this way, it also provides forgiveness for those that struggle to forgive others. In that way, forgiveness is motivated by gratefulness not fear.\r\n\r\nNow you may be asking, <a title=\"Randy Hagin - Which covenant did Jesus teach?\" href=\"http://www.ecclesia.org/truth/covenant.html\" target=\"_blank\">why would Jesus have said those things and aren't they important?</a> And that's worth a full article by itself and is more in-depth than I've studied for. But for what I can say, it is important for the purpose it was serving. If I had to say it briefly it would be this: Jesus had to put the law into it's proper place to convict people's hearts, especially prideful, self-righteousness people. To the humble he showed his grace, but to those who thought the law was doable he always implied, \"Still one thing you lack!\" He did this to convict the world of sin and hold people accountable to God, showing that it's not enough to obey the law in action only, but it must also be obeyed in the heart. If man wanted to live by the law, it was Jesus's job to show him just how hard he must work. The hope is that, people realizing the extent to which they were fallen would turn to Jesus and seek his mercy which would be given in full measure at the cross.\r\n\r\nDo not take this article as an end all to the discussion, but rather take it as another perspective and argument in how we should interpret the scripture. I would encourage you to research and come to your own conclusions on the subject.",

          "content:encoded": "I would encourage you to read <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 10</a> before you read this article to get some context for the passage we will be discussing. I'm going to be studying verses 26 through 31. Some of you know I already have a post on this subject, but I'm afraid I made it too long for most people to read.\r\n<blockquote><span id=\"en-NIV-30160\" class=\"text Heb-10-26\"><sup class=\"versenum\">26 </sup>If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-30161\" class=\"text Heb-10-27\"><sup class=\"versenum\">27 </sup>but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-30162\" class=\"text Heb-10-28\"><sup class=\"versenum\">28 </sup>Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-30163\" class=\"text Heb-10-29\"><sup class=\"versenum\">29 </sup>How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-30164\" class=\"text Heb-10-30\"><sup class=\"versenum\">30 </sup>For we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,”<span style=\"font-size:9px;line-height:22px;\"> </span>and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-30165\" class=\"text Heb-10-31\"><sup class=\"versenum\">31 </sup>It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span></blockquote>\r\nMany people see parallels between this passage and <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+6%3A4-8&amp;version=NIV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+6%3A4-8&amp;version=NIV\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 6:4-8</a>. The difference I want you to realize in these two passages it that it seems the author is addressing two different groups of people. In Hebrews 6 he is addressing hebrew christians who are ignorant and need to be taught the supremacy of Jesus Christ. They are continuing to offer animal sacrifices not realizing that those rituals are insulting Christ. Hebrews 10 addresses unbelieving Jews who have realized the message of Jesus but rejected him and in replacement continue to offer animal sacrifices willfully.\r\n\r\nSo what's the big deal about animal sacrifices and for that matter, the old covenant rituals? Imagine for a second you leave your wife to go on a missions trip and you bring a photo of her to help you remember her. And let's imagine that when you found yourself thinking of her you would kiss the photo. Now after a few weeks you return home and finally see your wife. But while she is waiting to kiss you, instead you continue to kiss the photograph.\r\n\r\nThe purifying rituals of the old testament were there as shadows to point us to Christ and to serve as illustrations of what he would eventually accomplish. But now that Christ has come in person and paid the penalty for our sins it is no longer a romantic thing to continue to perform those rituals. In fact they are like an insult, saying that his sacrifice was insufficient.\r\n\r\nThis is the warning given in Hebrews 6 and 10. For the christian, it is a warning that those rituals will be burned in the end (they will have no value). In Hebrews 10 the warning is that they are very near destruction for not believing in Christ, perhaps alluding to the destruction of the temple in 70AD.\r\n\r\nSo what evidence is there as to what this passage means?\r\n\r\nFirst of all the verses leading up to it are talking about how God was not pleased with their sacrifices, that they are insufficient, and how they are no longer necessary. Second the 'we' in 'if we deliberately keep on sinning' doesn't have to refer to christians, but can be 'we people,' or more specifically 'we jews,' since these problems are almost entirely jewish.\r\n\r\nHe also describes these people as 'enemies of God,' comparing them to people who 'rejected' the law of moses (the old covenant). He also describes them as people who shrink back and are destroyed, all the while reminding his readers that they have faith and are saved.\r\n\r\nWhat about the part 'who has insulted the Spirit of grace?' Other christians I've meet have said that if you keep on sinning after you have been forgiven then you are insulting God's grace. This does not seem accurate, after all, isn't that what grace is for to begin with? Isn't the whole point of grace coming from the fact that we will always need forgiveness and none of us could keep the law? To insult God's grace is to ignore it, call it worthless, and treat it as if it had no value. That's a picture of what was happening when these pious jews were continuing to offer their animal sacrifices. It was calling Jesus's death and the resulting grace worthless.\r\n\r\nThen we see the verse 'the Lord will judge his people,' which we might at first define as christians. But since he is quoting from the old testament dealing with jews and since here he is talking to jews it seems 'his people' would be referring to jews, God's chosen people under the first covenant.\r\n\r\nFinally the word sin in Hebrews is used a little differently than in other books. When we picture willful sin, we picture someone stealing or lusting deliberately and against all warning. If you read <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+4\">Hebrews 4</a> take note of how many times the words sin and unbelief are used interchangeably. This is because he is using the Israelites rejecting God in unbelief and not entering the promise land as an illustration for the kind of sin he is referring to throughout Hebrews. He uses this passage for christians to persuade them to enter God's rest (a rest from their own legalistic works, especially rituals), and to these unbelieving jews, showing that they are not just in danger of insulting Christ, but they are willfully rejecting him and there is a swift judgement approaching.\r\n\r\nSo when the author is talking about willful sin, it means <strong>willful unbelief</strong>, with a picture of these unbelieving jews offering their animal sacrifices in the temple. They have received the knowledge of truth, they have heard what Christ did, but they chose to believe he was not their messiah and continue to believe that they need to offer their sacrifices. Not only that, but they are persecuting and persuading jewish christians to do the same, making them feel insecure in what Christ accomplished or at least making life hard on them for believing so.\r\n\r\nI believe entering God's rest is meant to be seen both as a state that you come into when you believe in Christ and as resulting, complimentary action of letting go of faith in the old things. Christians may struggle with the action part. Though they are positionally in God's rest since they are in Christ, they may not be living through God's rest as the resulting action. In that case it is due to ignorance: they do not understand that Jesus completed his work and they still think there are things they need to do to maintain their salvation. But if someone does know that Jesus finished his work and yet they disregard that as useless and continually and willfully persist in the old rituals, they prove by their deeds that they do not believe in Him at all.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 4:3 \"For we which have believed do enter into rest\"\r\n\r\nHebrews 6:1 \"Therefore leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works ((useless rituals)) and of faith toward God,\"</blockquote>\r\nSo how can we take these lessons into today's world? We may not struggle with the legalistic rituals of the old covenant, but perhaps we have invented 'rituals' of our own that are supposed to accomplish something that God already has. Can you think of something in your life that you depend on for forgiveness or being right with God besides Christ crucified and Christ alone? How about confession? How about tithing? How about fasting for more intimacy or your daily quiet time with the purpose being God's acceptance? Even good things can become rituals depending on how we use them. Are these rituals supposed to make you right with God and somehow if you fail to do them you will be cursed or unforgiven? Could these rituals be insulting Jesus's finished work and do we need to repent of them and put faith in God?\r\n\r\nI want to remind you that there is grace for churches that perform ritualistic works, because they do so in ignorance. The warning we have as christians is that these useless rituals will be worth nothing in the end and will be burned. <a title=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/hebrews-6-condensed/\" href=\"http://revelationsingrace.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/hebrews-6-condensed/\">Hebrews 6</a> explains this. So as you seek to purify your conscience and faith of these rituals, don't forget to show grace and gentleness to those who do not understand.",

          "content:encoded": "<blockquote>Romans 6:14 \"For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace.\"</blockquote>\r\nThere is a lot of confusion in churches over whether the believer is under the law and to what degree. Many people say there must be a balance of law and grace. They argue the when the apostles talked about being free from the law, they only meant the ceremonial law. And even people who do realize we are under the Spirit may suppose he convicts us of sin just like the law does. I hope to explain the new covenant's perspective on this issue and encourage you to trust in the Spirit instead of your flesh (under the law). When I say we are not under the law, I am not saying we should use our freedom to sin, only that our lives are free from it's condemnation, guilt, and grip and are free to walk in the Spirit (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A13&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A13&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 5:13</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A15&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A15&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 6:15</a>).\r\n<h2>No longer under law</h2>\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_411\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"225\" class=\"    \"]<a href=\"http://revelationsingrace.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/the-ten1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-411\" src=\"http://revelationsingrace.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/the-ten1.jpg?w=225\" alt=\"The Law\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> The ministry of death and condemnation[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe new testament is very clear on the fact that a believer is no longer under the law.

What are some of the key verses from these books?\r\n<blockquote>Galatians 3:10-11 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-29073\" class=\"text Gal-3-10\">But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, “Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God’s Book of the Law.”</span><span id=\"en-NLT-29074\" class=\"text Gal-3-11\">So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by trying to keep the law. For the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.”<span style=\"font-size:8px;line-height:22px;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-29075\" class=\"text Gal-3-12\">This way of faith is very different from the way of law, which says, “It is through obeying the law that a person has life.\"</span>\r\n\r\nGalatians 5:1, 4 \"So Christ has truly set us free. Now make sure that you stay free, and don’t get tied up again in slavery to the law... For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by keeping the law, you have been cut off from Christ! You have fallen away from God’s grace.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 6:14 \"Sin is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the requirements of the law. Instead, you live under the freedom of God’s grace.\"\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A20&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A20&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 3:20</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A24&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A24&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 3:24</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:13-15\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:13-15\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 4:13-15</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 7</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+7:18-19\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+7:18-19\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 7:18-19</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+8%3A13&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+8%3A13&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 8:13</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A56&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15%3A56&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3:6\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3:6\" target=\"_blank\">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3%3A14-17&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3%3A14-17&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">2 Corinthians 3:14-17</a></blockquote>\r\nThese books make it abundantly clear we are no longer under law and should not try to be.\r\n<h2>But they only mean the ceremonial laws, right?</h2>\r\nThere is a popular argument that when the apostles talk about not being under the law they only mean the ceremonial laws, not the 10 commandments. The problem with this interpretation is it involves breaking up the law into parts. But the law says cursed is everyone who does not keep 'everything' written in this law. <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A10-12&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A10-12&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">James 2</a> says the same.\r\n\r\nThe law comes as a whole package. If this is not clear other verses specifically mention the 10 commandments.\r\n<blockquote>2 Corinthians 3:7, 11 \"<span class=\"text 2Cor-3-7\">The old way,<span style=\"font-size:8px;line-height:22px;\"> </span>with <strong>laws etched in stone </strong>(the ceremonial laws were never etched in stone, only the 10 commandments were), led to death, though it began with such glory that the people of Israel could not bear to look at Moses’ face...</span><span id=\"en-NLT-28812\" class=\"text 2Cor-3-10\"> </span><span id=\"en-NLT-28813\" class=\"text 2Cor-3-11\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup><strong>So if the old way, which has been replaced</strong>, was glorious, how much more glorious is the new, which remains forever!\"</span>\r\n\r\nRomans 7:7 \"I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said, \"You must not covet.\"</blockquote>\r\nOnly the 10 commandments say do not covet. Are we to think that Paul suddenly means the whole law in this verse but in every other only means the ceremonial law?\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A13&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A13&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 5:13</a> also warns us to use our freedom to serve others in love, not to satisfy our sinful nature. Why would he give this warning if they only understood this freedom only to be from ceremonial laws?\r\n<h2>What was the purpose of the law then?</h2>\r\nRomans, Galatians, and Hebrews all explain the purpose of the law.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 3:19-20 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-27972\" class=\"text Rom-3-19\">for its purpose is to keep people from having excuses, and <strong>to show that the entire world is guilty before God</strong>. </span><span id=\"en-NLT-27973\" class=\"text Rom-3-20\">For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands. The law simply <strong>shows us how sinful we are</strong>.\"</span>\r\n\r\nGalatians 3:19 \"Why, then, was the law given? It was given alongside the promise <strong>to show people their sins</strong>. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised.\"\r\n\r\nGalatians 3:24 \"So the law was our guardian until Christ came <strong>that we might be justified by faith</strong>.\"\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A1+&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+10%3A1+&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 10:1</a></blockquote>\r\nSo we see, the purpose was to show us how sinful we were and humble us before God so that when Christ came to save us, we would be ready to accept him.\r\n<h2>Didn't the law make us better people?</h2>\r\nThe purpose of the law was not to make us better people but to show us how much we needed Jesus. It was put in place to squash our pride in our abilities. In fact, the law could not have been used to make us better people, for it actually made the problem of sin worse. Not because of any fault of it's own, but because sin was able to use it for it's own purposes.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 15:56 \"<strong>the law gives sin its power</strong>.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 5:20 \"The law was brought in <strong>so that the trespass might increase</strong>.\"\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A5-6&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A5-6&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 7:5-6</a> \"<span id=\"en-NLT-28058\" class=\"text Rom-7-5\">When we were controlled by our old nature,<span style=\"font-size:8px;line-height:22px;\"> </span>sinful desires were at work within us, and <strong>the law aroused these evil desires that produced a harvest of sinful deeds</strong>, resulting in death.</span>\r\n\r\n<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A7-12&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A7-12&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 7:8, 11-12</a> \"<span id=\"en-NLT-28061\" class=\"text Rom-7-8\">But <strong>sin used this command to arouse all kinds of covetous desires within me</strong>! If there were no law, sin would not have that power... </span><span id=\"en-NLT-28064\" class=\"text Rom-7-11\">Sin took advantage of those commands and deceived me; it used the commands to kill me. </span><span id=\"en-NLT-28065\" class=\"text Rom-7-12\">But still, the law itself is holy, and its commands are holy and right and good.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nThe very commands that were supposed to make us better people, when combined with human nature, actually made us worse off. In the end we find that the law did not fix us and make us better people, it unintentionally brought more sin. Though the law remains good and holy, it cannot make us good and holy.\r\n<h2>Well how do you live without the law?</h2>\r\n<strong>By faith.</strong>\r\n\r\nFaith in Jesus, faith in God's grace, and faith in the Holy Spirit.\r\n\r\nFaith that Jesus did a good job in completely paying for and removing our sins from God's sight.\r\n<blockquote>John 19:30 \"When Jesus had tasted it, he said, \"It is finished!\" Then he bowed his head and released his spirit.\"</blockquote>\r\nFaith that no matter how bad we mess up God will forgive and cover our sins.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 4:4-8 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-27988\" class=\"text Rom-4-4\">When people work, their wages are not a gift, but something they have earned. </span><span id=\"en-NLT-27989\" class=\"text Rom-4-5\">But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners. </span><span id=\"en-NLT-27990\" class=\"text Rom-4-6\">David also spoke of this when he described the happiness of those who are declared righteous without working for it:</span>\r\n<div class=\"poetry top-1\">\r\n<p class=\"line\"><span id=\"en-NLT-27991\" class=\"text Rom-4-7\">“Oh, what joy for those</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Rom-4-7\">whose disobedience is forgiven,</span></span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Rom-4-7\">whose sins are put out of sight.</span></span>\r\n<span id=\"en-NLT-27992\" class=\"text Rom-4-8\">Yes, what joy for those</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Rom-4-8\">whose record the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> has cleared of sin.”\"</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">1 John 4:18 \"Such love has no fear, because perfect love expels all fear. If we are afraid, it is for fear of punishment, and this shows that we have not fully experienced his perfect love.\"</p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"poetry top-1\">\r\n<p class=\"line\">And faith in the Holy Spirit. Faith that he is at the core of the new nature God has given us and is working in our hearts to do the things that please God. So instead of throwing more willpower into changing ourselves, we trust in him.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Romans 8:5, 9 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-28083\" class=\"text Rom-8-5\">but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit... You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you.</span><span id=\"en-NLT-28084\" class=\"text Rom-8-6\">\"</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Galatians 5:16 \"So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won’t be doing what your sinful nature craves.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Philippians 2:13 \"For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\"><a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13%3A21&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+13%3A21&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 13:21</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+8%3A10&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+8%3A10&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Hebrews 8:10</a>, <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A22-23&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A22-23&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 5:22-23</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">God's Spirit lives in us, working in our hearts and minds what is pleasing to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"line\">How do I follow the Spirit?</h2>\r\n<p class=\"line\">The Spirit does not guide us into fear, but into God's grace, reminding us that we are righteous and loved by God (<strong>gifts freely given to us</strong>).</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">2 Corinthians 2:12 \"And we have received God’s Spirit (not the world’s spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God <strong>has freely given us</strong>.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Romans 8:15 \"So you have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves. Instead, you received God's Spirit when he adopted you as his own children. Now we call him, \"Abba, Father.\"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">The Holy Spirit is not your conscience! He does not go around nagging you into being a better person. That is a law based mentality and it's what Satan does.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Romans 12:10 \"for <strong>the accuser of our brethren</strong> is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">2 Corinthians 11:3, 14-15 \"But I fear that somehow your pure and undivided devotion to Christ will be corrupted, just as Eve was deceived by the cunning ways of the serpent... <span id=\"en-NLT-28964\" class=\"text 2Cor-11-14\">But I am not surprised! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. </span><span id=\"en-NLT-28965\" class=\"text 2Cor-11-15\">So it is no wonder that his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness.\"</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Remember what Satan did in the garden? He gave them something that was supposedly good, the knowledge of good and evil. The awareness of their sins.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Genesis 3:6-7 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-62\" class=\"text Gen-3-6\">The woman was convinced. She saw that the tree was beautiful and its fruit looked delicious, and <strong>she wanted the wisdom it would give her</strong>. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it, too. </span><span id=\"en-NLT-63\" class=\"text Gen-3-7\">At that moment <strong>their eyes were opened</strong>, <strong>and they suddenly felt shame</strong> at their nakedness. So they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.\"</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">The enemy was serving \"righteousness.\" But righteousness according the knowledge of good and evil. Righteousness according to the law. It brought the awareness of sin and shame. Not specifically because they disobeyed God, but because they realized it was wrong to be naked. The enemy wants to make you aware of your sins and use the law as his weapon. So if you hear a nagging voice pointing out your faults, it is not God's Spirit, but an evil conscience.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Hebrews 10:22 \"let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">1 John 3:20 \"Even if we feel guilty, God is greater than our feelings, and he knows everything.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\"></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">If your conscience is not being washed of guilt, then it is not God you are approaching. The Spirit guides though love, peace, joy, kindness, and gentleness. He will speak to your heart and motivate you to do good things, but will always keep you in remembrance of God's grace. He does not motivate through guilt, fear, and manipulation. Reject such leadings.</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">I hope these verses have given you something think about. It is a huge shift in life to move from under the law to under grace and I hope the prospect doesn't scare you. May God bless and help us to see his grace in full measure and may he fully set us free from the law in our thinking!</p>\r\n\r\n</div>",

The actual mechanics of language are a science of their own almost: but we follow a hebrew God who chose Israel and grafted us in.It's become as if us westerners think that God is 'ours' in terms of how we read His Word. We have never been taught that, we just assume it via our various churches etc. However when we start to realize that our hebrew heritage is spiritually important because of linguistic meaning then His Word becomes even more relevant. Which one of the 10 commandments do you think is no longer meant for today, or is it all of them?",

He does not change.To do so would be for Him to be a lesser being than God - not possible.\r\nPaul re-iterates this all through his letters: his teaching about lawlessness is proof of this. Paul was the messenger. His experience seated in his ancestry. He taught from The Law throughout his life. He did not waiver.\r\nFurthermore, Jesus would not have made His example on earth as the One who follows God's laws to then at the end of His work  say the Law no longer matters - that is simply to negate His works.It is not what He meant when He proclaimed 'it is finished'\r\nFreedom under the law:\r\nRom3.20 being conscious of sin because of knowing the Law.Being free of legalism as the pharisees had put the people under is not to be likened with being under The Law.\r\nJesus saved us and showed us what is right and how to live that way.He showed us that disobeying the Law was sin and seperates us from God. So knowing what i sin, if we then continue to do it, we are not righteous, not in communion with Him, not in anything with Him because we have ignored what He has taught us...there is a further journey for us after being saved. It is obedience. Who to? God.How do we know we are being obedient? By following His Law. [the parables of the sower and of the 10 virgins tells us what happens to those who do not hear and who are not ready].\r\nMatt 7 21-23\r\n\r\nRom 8 3-4\r\nHeb 8 10-12\r\nRom 10 4 - the greek word when translated correctly renders this verse 'Christ is the goal of the Law '",

Did you know God had made a covenant before he made the covenant of the law? He made a covenant with Abraham on the basis of faith by which he was declared righteous. Since God's word cannot die, then his covenant of faith cannot be replaced (Galatians 3:15-25). Paul however does tell us that a covenant is only binding on a person as long as he lives. When we spiritually died in Christ we were released from under the covenant of the law to serve the Spirit (the law written on our hearts) (Romans 7:1-6).\r\n\r\n1 Timothy 1:8-10 shows us that the law is useful if used properly. It is not made for the righteous but for sinners to show them their need for Christ. This again is what is meant by the verse you quoted Romans 10:4 and Romans 8:3-4. The law was supposed to make us right with God. When it says Christ is the fulfillment of the law and when it says that the just requirements of the law might be fully met in us it means that it required us to be right with God and we have been made right with God through faith alone\r\n\r\nJesus had to keep the law so that he would be declared righteous in God's sight. You see in the old covenant God required an unblemished lamb to act as a sacrifice. If Jesus had a blemish he would not be worthy of being our sacrifice. God validated his perfection by raising him from the dead. In Christ's death, we were released from the old covenant and established in a new because God found fault in the old (Hebrews 8:6-13). The law was given to humble us before God and show us Jesus so that we might relate to him on the basis of faith. The law is not based on faith (Galatians 3:12), but on works, which is contrasted in Romans 4.\r\n\r\nHebrews 10:19-22 shows us that our sins no more separate us from God and we may boldly enter the most holy of holies having are hearts sprinkled clean of a guilty conscience.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned in another post that you were confused about how we were grafted into the vine by which we all come under law (Romans 11). This grafting is not into the law but into Abraham's family and covenant, which predates the law as the context reveals.\r\n\r\nUnderstand I am not trying to dogmatically pin you, but when I started learning this stuff I argued against it myself and I'm glad God explained those confusing scriptures to me. I hope to do the same favor for you.",

          "content:encoded": "In the denomination I grew up in (non-denominational) the idea of being under grace was always an unclear subject. We were not directly taught that we were under law, but we rejected the idea of being totally under grace. In fact we still to this day are repeatedly warned about the dangers of this 'grace movement.' We hear scriptures like\r\n<blockquote>Jude 1:4 \"I say this because some ungodly people have wormed their way into your churches, saying that God’s marvelous grace allows us to live immoral lives. The condemnation of such people was recorded long ago, for they have denied our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.\"</blockquote>\r\nWe are told the grace movement gives people a license to sin and it's very dangerous. On this last point I would have to agree, it is dangerous, but not in the way we think.\r\n<h4>Separating Grace from Jesus</h4>\r\nThese people first of all were not believers. It said they have denied Jesus Christ. But we find a principle here that shows us how grace must be taught. Anyone who says they teach grace, but use it as a license to sin really don't get grace at all. It never inspires sin and does not encourage it.\r\n\r\nHowever we must realize why we have grace for it not to do this. If we think God has gone soft on sin and doesn't care anymore we have a recipe for license. But when we realize that God has not gone soft on sin but was justly punishing sin in Jesus... that Jesus had to be brutally killed to give it to us... then we have a recipe for a heart change. Realizing that Jesus died for our sins does not make us want to go and live a sinful lifestyle. Instead it makes us grateful and results in many good works. This then is the key: when grace it taught, it must be realized that it is only possible because of Jesus Christ and that the grace we enjoy today cost him immense suffering and death. When that is in place we have a recipe for a heart transformation something I would consider \"dangerous.\"",

          "content:encoded": "If you've grown up under a law based mentality it's easy to think that being free under God's grace means that people will live lazy or desperately sinful lives.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 6:15 \"<sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup>What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?\"</blockquote>\r\nIn the letter of Titus, Paul is confident that this message is able to produce a harvest of good deeds:\r\n<blockquote>\"teach them to know the truth that shows them how to live godly lives\" (Titus 1:1) and \"promote the kind of living that reflects wholesome teaching (Titus 2:1).</blockquote>\r\nWhat is the truth he keeps talking about through Titus? Is it the law? Titus gives us some clues that prove he is talking about the message of grace. First in the next verse he says,\r\n<blockquote>Titus 1:2 \"This truth gives them confidence that they have eternal life, which God—who does not lie—promised them before the world began\"</blockquote>\r\nThe law does not give us confidence that we have eternal life. On the contrary it creates doubt because man knows he cannot keep the whole law. Paul also describes people who are opposing this truth message as people who insist on keeping the jewish law.\r\n<blockquote>Titus 1:10-11, 14 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-29863\" class=\"text Titus-1-10\">For there are many rebellious people who engage in useless talk and deceive others. This is especially true of those who insist on circumcision for salvation.</span> <span id=\"en-NLT-29864\" class=\"text Titus-1-11\">They must be silenced, because they are turning whole families away from the truth by their false teaching... They must stop listening to Jewish myths and the commands of people who have turned away from the truth.\"</span>\r\n\r\nTitus 3:9-11 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-29893\" class=\"text Titus-3-9\">Do not get involved in foolish discussions about spiritual pedigrees<span style=\"font-size:9px;line-height:22px;\"> </span>or in quarrels and fights about obedience to Jewish laws. These things are useless and a waste of time.</span><span id=\"en-NLT-29894\" class=\"text Titus-3-10\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup>If people are causing divisions among you, give a first and second warning. After that, have nothing more to do with them.<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-29895\" class=\"text Titus-3-11\">For people like that have turned away from the truth, and their own sins condemn them.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nPaul knows they hold to the law and argue it as a way for salvation but they themselves do not keep it and so he shows how fruitless that teaching is.\r\n<blockquote>Titus 1:12-14, 16 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-29865\" class=\"text Titus-1-12\">Even one of their own men, a prophet from Crete, has said about them, “The people of Crete are all liars, cruel animals, and lazy gluttons.”</span><span id=\"en-NLT-29866\" class=\"text Titus-1-13\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup>This is true. So reprimand them sternly to make them strong in the faith.<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-29867\" class=\"text Titus-1-14\">They must stop listening to Jewish myths and the commands of people who have turned away from the truth... Such people claim they know God, but they deny him by the way they live. They are detestable and disobedient, worthless for doing anything good.\"</span></blockquote>\r\nFinally he describes this message of truth and it's proper consequence in these verses:\r\n<blockquote>Titus 2:11-14 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-29880\" class=\"text Titus-2-11\"><strong>For the grace of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to all people</strong>.<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-29881\" class=\"text Titus-2-12\">And we are instructed to turn from godless living and sinful pleasures. We should live in this evil world with wisdom, righteousness, and devotion to God,<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-29882\" class=\"text Titus-2-13\">while we look forward with hope to that wonderful day when the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, will be revealed.</span> <span id=\"en-NLT-29883\" class=\"text Titus-2-14\"><strong>He gave his life to free us from every kind of sin, to cleanse us, and to make us his very own people, totally committed to doing good deeds.</strong>\"</span></blockquote>\r\n(Most translations say \"<strong>It [God's grace] teaches us</strong> to say \"No\" to ungodliness and worldly passions...\" showing that grace is responsible.)\r\n<blockquote>Titus 3:4-8 \"<span class=\"text Titus-3-4\">When God our Savior revealed his kindness and love,<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-29889\" class=\"text Titus-3-5\">he saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit. </span><span id=\"en-NLT-29890\" class=\"text Titus-3-6\">He generously poured out the Spirit upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior.<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-29891\" class=\"text Titus-3-7\">Because of his grace he declared us righteous and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life. </span>This is a trustworthy saying, and <strong>I want you to insist on these teachings so that all who trust in God will devote themselves to doing good</strong>. These teachings are good and beneficial for everyone.\"</blockquote>\r\nPaul does not subjugate God's grace to how well we keep good works, rather he commands us to hold tightly to the word of grace which is able to produce a harvest of good works in us. Notice the simple logic, \"insist on God's grace (the truth)\" so that all who trust in God will \"devote themselves to doing good.\" In Paul's mind, God's kindness and grace motivates believers to live lives devoted to God full of good works. Whereas those who argue about keeping jewish commands are fruitless and need to be corrected. It serves as a simple illustration of being under law vs being under grace.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 7:4-6 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-28057\" class=\"text Rom-7-4\">So, my dear brothers and sisters, this is the point: You died to the power of the law when you died with Christ. And now you are united with the one who was raised from the dead. As a result, we can produce a harvest of good deeds for God.<span style=\"font-family:Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-NLT-28058\" class=\"text Rom-7-5\">When we were controlled by our old nature,<span style=\"font-size:9px;line-height:22px;\"> </span>sinful desires were at work within us, and the law aroused these evil desires that produced a harvest of sinful deeds, resulting in death.</span><span id=\"en-NLT-28059\" class=\"text Rom-7-6\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup>But now we have been released from the law, for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power. Now we can serve God, not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way of living in the Spirit.\"</span></blockquote>",

          "content:encoded": "In the old covenant God's people were characterized by the sign of circumcision. Circumcision began with Abraham to mark that he had faith and was accepted as righteous before God. However, Abraham was justified with God before he was circumcised showing that God's acceptance of him was not dependent on this sign.\r\n<blockquote>Romans 4:9-11 \"<span id=\"en-NLT-27993\" class=\"text Rom-4-9\">Well, we have been saying that Abraham was counted as righteous by God because of his faith. </span><span id=\"en-NLT-27994\" class=\"text Rom-4-10\">But how did this happen? Was he counted as righteous only after he was circumcised, or was it before he was circumcised? Clearly, God accepted Abraham before he was circumcised! </span>Circumcision was a sign that Abraham already had faith and that God had already accepted him and declared him to be righteous—even before he was circumcised.\"</blockquote>\r\nWe know that the new testament no longer requires us to be circumcised (<a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2%3A29&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+2%3A29&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">Romans 2:29</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A11&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A11&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">Colossians 2:11</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A2&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A2&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 5:2</a>), but for the christian, circumcision has a much deeper meaning.\r\n<blockquote>Colossians 2:11 \"When you came to Christ, you were \"circumcised,\" but not by a physical procedure. Christ performed a spiritual circumcision--the cutting away of your sinful nature.\"\r\n\r\nRomans 2:29 \"No, a true Jew is one whose heart is right with God. And true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the law; rather, it is a change of heart produced by God's Spirit.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe point I want to make is this: we believers are justified and made righteous by faith alone. We are accepted by God because we believe in Christ. However we receive this spiritual circumcision as confirmation that we believed. The apostles Paul and John look for this evidence in believers to see if they are saved or not. That is why Jesus gave us two commandments.\r\n<blockquote>1 John 3:23 \"And this is his commandment: We must believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as he commanded us.\"</blockquote>\r\nJust like Abraham, when we believe in Jesus we are made righteous and accepted by God and later, sometimes to our surprise, we find love and gratefulness in our heart which is coming from the Spirit that lives in us.\r\n<blockquote>Hebrews 10:15-17 \"This is the new covenant I will make with my people on that day, says the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>:\r\n<div class=\"poetry top-1\">\r\n<p class=\"line\"><span class=\"text Heb-10-16\">\"I will put my laws in their hearts,</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-10-16\">and I will write them on their minds.”</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"first-line-none top-1\"><span id=\"en-NLT-30111\" class=\"text Heb-10-17\">Then he says,</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"poetry top-1\">\r\n<p class=\"line\"><span class=\"text Heb-10-17\">“I will never again remember</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Heb-10-17\">their sins and lawless deeds.”\"</span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">1 John 4:8 \"But anyone who does not love does not know God, for God is love.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">1 John 2:29 \"If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">1 John 3:9-10 \"No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God. <strong>By this it is evident who are the children of God</strong>\"</p>\r\n\r\n</div></blockquote>\r\n<div class=\"poetry top-1\">\r\n<p class=\"line\">God's \"seed\" is the Holy Spirit living in us who shows everyone of us God's love and reminds us of his incredible grace. As we come to accept his love we find ourselves living grateful and generous lives. And that generosity is evidence that we know God's love which came through the what Jesus did.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"poetry top-1\">\r\n<h2 class=\"line\">What if Christians continue to sin?</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"poetry top-1\">\r\n<p class=\"line\">If we have the Holy Spirit in us why do we continue to sin? We've all had times in our lives where we really messed up after becoming a Christian and sometimes we've dealt with sinful habits that lasted for years even as a Christian.</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">The Holy Spirit is actively at work healing us and leading us out of those things and I'm sure there have been times where you found victories over those habits or behaviors. But having the Holy Spirit doesn't mean we now live perfect lives. Note that the same author who said we don't continue in sin also said this:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">1 John 2:1-2 But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate who pleads our case before the Father. He is Jesus Christ, the one who is truly righteous. He himself is the sacrifice that atones for our sins—and not only our sins but the sins of all the world.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">And</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Philippians 3:3 For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put <strong>no confidence in the flesh</strong></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">This is the awesome part of our gospel. Even after becoming a Christian when you sin God's grace keeps getting bigger (Romans 5:20). The more you fail the more you find God's love and the more you realize the price Jesus paid for you. And if you ever accept that reality, it changes your life and becomes the very thing that leads you out of sin (2 Peter 1:5-9).</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">We all struggle with accepting God's grace and love, sometimes because it's too good to be true. Even the apostle Paul didn't fully grasp it.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Philippians 3:8-9, 12 \"<span id=\"en-NIV-29430\" class=\"text Phil-3-8\">I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ</span><span id=\"en-NIV-29431\" class=\"text Phil-3-9\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup>and be found in him, <strong>not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in<span style=\"font-size:8.75px;line-height:22px;\"> </span>Christ</strong>—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith...<span style=\"font-size:10px;line-height:10px;\"> </span><strong>Not that I have already obtained all this</strong>, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.\"</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">And when we don't grasp and believe in the forgiveness and righteousness that God has given us in love we may find ourselves stuck in bad habits because we don't know his love.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">1 John 4:8 But anyone who does not love does not know God, for God is love.</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">1 John 4:19 We love because he first loved us.</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Luke 7:47 But a person who is forgiven little shows only little love.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">We doubt his grace, we suppose we've hit those intolerable limits, we think we have to earn it, we think God gives up on us, etc...</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">But the good news is that we are forgiven of all our sins, including those committed after becoming Christians.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Romans 5:9 \"And since we have been made right in God’s sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God’s condemnation.\"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">However in the long run of your life you will see evidence that your faith is real because the Holy Spirit is continually at work in you reminding you of God's love and softening your heart with grace.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"line\">Works follow Grace</h2>\r\n<p class=\"line\">So when Jesus gives us two commands: to believe and to love, the first alone justifies us before God and the second justifies us before man to prove the first. The second one is a fruit of the first, it is the \"sign\" of circumcision.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">James 2:21-24 \"Don’t you remember that our ancestor Abraham was shown to be right with God by his actions when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? You see, his faith and his actions worked together. His actions made his faith complete. And so it happened just as the Scriptures say: “Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.” He was even called the friend of God. So you see, we are <strong>shown to be right with God</strong> by what we do, not by faith alone.\"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Notice here James does not say \"we are right with God by what we do\" but rather \"are shown to be right with God by what we do.\" We are right with God before we have done anything and we receive the ability to do right as a sign that God's Spirit was given to us.</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">I want to give another example to show that it is faith alone and not faith and works that makes us right with God.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Luke 23: 39-43\"One of the criminals hanging beside him scoffed, “So you’re the Messiah, are you? Prove it by saving yourself—and us, too, while you’re at it!”</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">But the other criminal protested, “Don’t you fear God even when you have been sentenced to die? We deserve to die for our crimes, but this man hasn’t done anything wrong.” Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">And Jesus replied, “I assure you, today you will be with me in paradise.”</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">This criminal had no godly actions to prove he was saved other than the fact that he simply believed and confessed that Jesus was the Messiah. This action alone was enough to justify him.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"line\">Understanding difficult passages</h2>\r\n<p class=\"line\">So when we see scriptures like,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Ephesians 5:5 \"You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\"><a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A19-21&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+5%3A19-21&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">Galatians 5:19-21</a> | <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A9-10&amp;version=NLT\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+6%3A9-10&amp;version=NLT\" target=\"_blank\">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">we know he is assuming that these people are not saved because their radically sinful behavior does not show evidence of it. He is not referring to christians who sometimes stumble even with these particular sins. All christians will inherit the kingdom of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">2 Corinthians 1:22 \"and he has identified us as his own by placing the Holy Spirit in our hearts as the first installment that guarantees everything he has promised us.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"line\">Ephesians 1:13-14 \"And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago. The Spirit is God’s guarantee that he will give us the inheritance he promised and that he has purchased us to be his own people.\"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"line\">I am not saying that a believer can never act greedy or impure, but he is not defined by those things and does not make a practice of sinning because of God's Spirit in him.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"line\">Only the pure gospel of grace can produce love</h2>\r\nSo what about people who for a while leave the church, quit being Christians, or struggle with awful habits. Why would they do that if they have the Holy Spirit? It may be due to never hearing the full pure gospel. I want to end this article with a warning to churches, not from myself but from scripture.\r\n<blockquote>2 Peter 1:5-9 \"In view of all this, make every effort to respond to God’s promises. Supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone.\r\n\r\nThe more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But <strong>those who fail to develop in this way</strong> are shortsighted or blind, <strong>forgetting that they have been cleansed from their old sins</strong>.\"</blockquote>\r\nSometimes the reason we don't see good fruit being produced in a believer's life is because there is no gospel in his heart producing that fruit. What I mean is even though he is saved he does not fully realize that he is forgiven and so he continues to manifest those old habits.\r\n\r\nThis is why we must be careful to teach good doctrine at churches. If we teach conditional salvation and forgiveness determined by behavior, then when people fail they won't be able to believe they are forgiven and will continue to digress! And instead of realizing we are not teaching the gospel we claim they are not christians because they don't bear good fruit! If you are the only water source to a plant and you do not give it water how do you expect it to flourish? Why do you blame the plant for not producing fruit when you neglect to give it proper nutrients?\r\n\r\nThe apostles were assuming good fruit from believers partially because they knew they were teaching good doctrine. An impure gospel will produce impure fruit and it's harder to determine who's saved.\r\n\r\nSo if your gospel takes the free gift of forgiveness, salvation and righteousness and introduces a few reasons to doubt that we may not continue to have or receive them then your gospel may be one of the reasons people are turning away from the Lord.\r\n<p class=\"line\"></p>\r\n\r\n</div>",

The traditional interpretation of this parable centers around what the oil represents. It is pertinent to note traditionally it is interpreted that the oil represents the Holy Spirit. As such believers were taught that if there is no oil in your lamp, that is, if you are not filled with the Holy Spirit, you will not be allowed to enter the marriage of the Lamb. So there you go. That’s the interpretation of the parable. Hence you can lose your salvation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Problems with the traditional interpretation</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do you have oil in your lamp? Let me rephrase that. That is a wrong question. Both set of virgins actually had oil in their lamps. Just that one set of virgins had oil to spare, while the other does’t. Hmm, is Jesus try to teach out not to fully utilize the Spirit so that there would be more of Him left? Is Jesus trying to say that the Holy Spirit can be saved up for further use? What say you?\r\n\r\nI think you can see the silliness of that interpretation. The Holy Spirit is a person. You cannot have more or less of him. You either have Him or not. By the way John 14:16 tells you the Holy Spirit is given to you forever and Paul tells you in Ephesians 4:30 that the Holy Spirit is sealed until the day you meet Jesus face to face. Then what in the world is Jesus talking about? 50% saved and 50% not saved. Is he saying half of the church will be saved and half not?\r\n\r\nIf so how do have more oil? By doing more for Jesus? By accumulating works? Hmm that cannot be. Cause if that is true, how much works does one person has to do before its considered enough? I had always struggle with this.\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\nThe need to realize that the parable of the virgins were directed to the Jews.\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me give you an idea of what happens at a Jewish wedding. Yup I said it, that’s the 1st clue. It is a  Jewish wedding and not a Gentile wedding. Here’s the roll call. The Jewish marriage took place in three stages over a long period of time. When the couple was still very young, an Engagement was arranged by the parents, sometimes with the help of a “matchmaker”. Second, there was a Betrothal ceremony held at the bride’s house. The couple exchanged vows and the groom gave the bride presents. This period lasted for a year or two, but the bride continued to live with her parents. \r\n\r\nDuring this time the bride was said to be “betrothed” or “espoused” to the young man. The Marriage Supper came next. It usually happened at night. The groom and his friends came to the bride’s house. She would be wearing a thick veil. She and her friends would accompany the groom and his friends to his father’s house or maybe a larger hall where the festivities would take place. A contract was signed.\r\n\r\nThe bride and groom would spend time together, and then the bride would remain by herself for seven days. At the end of the week, the bride would return to the group, remove her veil so that everyone could see her. If the young woman had never been married, the feast would last for seven days. If she were a widow remarrying, it would last for three days.\r\n\r\nThe five foolish girls had no extra oil. They wanted to borrow some from the wise girls, but they refused. They said there might not be enough for all of them. They urged the girls to go and buy some oil from someone who had it for sale. The girls left to go find a merchant who would sell them oil. While they were gone, the bridegroom arrived and the five wise girls and the rest of the wedding party went inside. The door was shut. The five foolish girls came back. They shouted for someone to open the door for them, but sadly there was no way for them to enter. \r\n\r\nThe bridegroom replied, “I tell you the truth. I don’t know you.”\r\n\r\nIf the “oil” is the Holy Spirit then pray tell me, can you buy Him? If it is your works can you go outside and buy \r\nmore credits to works?\r\n\r\nI guess not. \r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Hence what is this parable about?</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is about being prepared. Be prepared because the Lord could have come anytime.\r\n\r\nBut the nagging issue is this? Does it mean of 50% of believers will make it to the wedding supper?\r\n\r\nMatthew 24 is not about the Gentile Church. It is about the Jewish nation and what will happen to them within the generation Jesus visited. \r\n\r\nThis concept is fundamental to understanding this parable. These portions of Scriptures actually refer to Jews and \r\nwhat was going to happen to them as nation. They do not refer to the church. \r\n\r\n<strong>Which generation did this parable referred to?</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s visit <strong>Matthew 24.</strong> \r\n\r\nYou would note Jesus actually said that it will come within his generation. \r\n\r\n“34 Truly I tell you, <strong>this generation</strong> will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.”\r\n\r\nIt is important for us to realize this was about his generation and not ours. Just have a look at what he said about his generation: \r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 11:15-17</strong> \r\n15 Whoever has ears, let them hear.\r\n16 ‘To what can I compare <strong>this generation</strong>? They are like children sitting in the market-places and calling out to others:\r\n17 ‘“We played the pipe for you,\r\n    and you did not dance;\r\nwe sang a dirge,\r\n    and you did not mourn.”\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 12:39 </strong>\r\nHe answered, ‘<strong>A wicked and adulterous generatio</strong>n asks for a sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 12:42 </strong>\r\nThe Queen of the South will rise at the judgment <strong>with this generation</strong> and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 12:45 </strong>\r\nThen it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this <strong>wicked generation</strong>.’\r\n\r\nLastly look at this verse: \r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 23:35-37</strong>\r\n35 And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. 36 Truly I tell you, <strong>all this will come upon this generation</strong>.\r\n37 ‘Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.\r\n\r\nNote the very thing Jesus said “‘Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.”\r\n\r\nJesus was speaking about the impending judgment that would come on the people of that generation. \r\n\r\nAlso see <strong>Revelation 6: 9 </strong>\r\nWhen he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained. 10 They called out in a loud voice, ‘How long, Sovereign told to wait a little longer, until the full number of their fellow servants, their brothers and sisters,[c] were killed just as they had been.\r\n\r\nNotice these group of people who cried out for vengeance? They were about to be avenged. Who are these people?\r\n\r\n<strong>Matthew 23:35-37</strong>\r\n35 And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, <strong>from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah</strong>, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. \r\n\r\nNote how Jesus warned the people to leave Jerusalem and how Jesus said the angels would gather the elect.\r\n \r\nMatthew 24: <strong>16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out of the house. 18 Let no one in the field go back to get their cloak.</strong> 19 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! 20 Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great distress, unequalled from the beginning of the world until now – and never to be equalled again.\r\n\r\nThis is a warning about the impending wrath that would come in the destruction of Jerusalem within that generation.\r\n A generation is 40 years, Jesus died in AD 33, 40 years would mean around AD70. \r\n\r\nI also would want to see who the elect were. \r\n\r\nFirst in <strong>Matthew 24: 31</strong> \r\n\r\nAnd he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.\r\n\r\nNow in <strong>Revelation 7: 1</strong>\r\nAfter this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree. 2 Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea: 3 ‘Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.’ 4 Then I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.\r\n\r\nSee <strong>the elect were Jews</strong>. This is a passage asking the Jews to leave Jerusalem before its destruction. \r\n\r\nIn case you are wondering the term “heaven and earth” refers to the temple. \r\n\r\nHere’s a video to explain it:\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy2AQlK6C5k\r\n\r\nThe temple together with Jerusalem were destroyed in AD70. \r\n\r\nSo the parable of the virgins is really a warning to escape Jerusalem. Many people relate this to rapture and how a trumpet shall sound. \r\n\r\nIf you read Joel 2, you will read about an account of what eventually took place in AD70 when Jerusalem was surrounded and destroyed by the Romans. Do you what is the 1st verse of Joel 2?\r\n\r\n<strong>Joel 2:1</strong>\r\n“<strong>Blow the trumpet in Zion</strong>; sound the alarm on my holy hill. Let all who live in the land tremble, for the day of the LORD is coming. It is close at hand—“\r\nMatthew 24 is not about the rapture. It is about the end of the old covenant. Let me show you from wikipidea what happen in AD70.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>The siege of Jerusalem</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n“Despite early successes in repelling the Roman sieges, the Zealots fought amongst themselves, and they lacked proper leadership, resulting in poor discipline, training, and preparation for the battles that were to follow.\r\nTitus surrounded the city, with three legions (V Macedonica, XII Fulminata, XV Apollinaris) on the western side and a fourth (X Fretensis) on the Mount of Olives to the east. \r\n\r\nHe put pressure on the food and water supplies of the inhabitants by allowing pilgrims to enter the city to celebrate Passover, and then refusing to allow them back out. After Jewish allies killed a number of Roman soldiers, Titus sent Josephus, the Jewish historian, to negotiate with the defenders; this ended with Jews wounding the negotiator with an arrow, and another sally was launched shortly after. Titus was almost captured during this sudden attack, but escaped.\r\n\r\nIn mid-May Titus set to destroying the newly built Third Wall with a ram, breaching it as well as the Second Wall, and turning his attention to the Fortress of Antonia just north of the Temple Mount. The Romans were then drawn into street fighting with the Zealots, who were then ordered to retreat to the temple to avoid heavy losses. \r\n\r\nJosephus failed in another attempt at negotiations, and Jewish attacks prevented the construction of siege towers at the Fortress of Antonia. Food, water, and other provisions were dwindling inside the city, but small foraging parties managed to sneak supplies into the city, harrying Roman forces in the process. \r\n\r\nTo put an end to the foragers, <strong>orders were issued to build a new wall, and siege tower construction</strong> was restarted as well.” \r\n\r\n<strong>Titus built a new wall</strong>. No one could get out. If these people had not listen to Jesus, they would now not be able to escape. They were trapped in the siege. \r\n\r\nNow I will quote the parable to you. \r\n\r\n<strong>The Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins</strong>\r\n\r\n25 “Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2 Now five of them were wise, and five were foolish.3 Those who were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them, 4 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 5 But while the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept.\r\n\r\n6 “And at midnight a cry was heard: ‘Behold, the bridegroom is coming;[a] go out to meet him!’ 7 Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. 8 And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ 9 But the wise answered, saying, ‘No, lest there should not be enough for us and you; but go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’ 10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; <strong>and the door was shut</strong>.\r\n\r\nThe door being shut here means the building of that wall by Titus which effectively started the siege. \r\nIt is important to realize that the coming of the Son of Man took place in AD70 as testified by historians. Here are some of the quotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Historical accounts of Jesus’ coming in the clouds in AD 70.</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n“<strong>Josephus (A.D. 75) - Jewish Historian</strong>\r\n\r\n\"Besides these [signs], a few days after that feast, on the one- and-twentieth day of the month Artemisius, [Jyar,] a certain prodigious and incredible phenomenon appeared; I suppose the account of it would seem to be a fable, were it not related by those that saw it, and were not the events that followed it of so considerable a nature as to deserve such signals; for, <strong>before sun-setting, chariots and troops of soldiers in their armour were seen running about among the clouds, and surrounding of cities.</strong> Moreover, at that feast which we call Pentecost, as the priests were going by night into the inner [court of the] temple, as their custom was, to perform their sacred ministrations, they said that, in the first place, they felt a quaking, and heard a great noise, and after that they heard a sound as of a great multitude, saying, \"Let us remove hence\" (Jewish Wars, VI-V-3).\r\n\r\n“A supernatural apparition was seen, too amazing to be believed. What I am now to relate would, I imagine, be dismissed as imaginary, had this not been vouched for by eyewitnesses, then followed by subsequent disasters that deserved to be thus signalized. <strong>For before sunset chariots were seen in the air over the whole country, and armed battalions speeding through the clouds and encircling the cities</strong>.”  (rendered in Chilton)\r\n\r\n<strong>Tacitus (A.D. 11- Roman historian)</strong>\r\n\r\n\"13. Prodigies had occured, but their expiation by the offering of victims or solemn vows is held to be unlawful by a nation which is the slave of superstition and the enemy of true beliefs.<strong> In the sky appeared a vision of armies in conflict, of glittering armour. A sudden lightning flash from the clouds lit up the Temple. The doors of the holy place abruptly opened, a superhuman voice was heard to declare that the gods were leaving it, and in the same instant came the rushing tumult of their departure.</strong> Few people placed a sinister interpretation upon this. The majority were convinced that the ancient scriptures of their priests alluded to the present as the very time when the Orient would triumph and from Judaea would go forth men destined to rule the world.\" (Histories, Book 5, v. 13).”\r\n\r\nWhat happened to those who did not escape? \r\nJosephus claims that 1.1 million people were killed during the siege, of which a majority were Jewish, and that 97,000 were captured and enslaved, including Simon bar Giora and John of Giscala.\r\n\r\n\"The slaughter within was even more dreadful than the spectacle from without. Men and women, old and young, insurgents and priests, those who fought and those who entreated mercy, were hewn down in indiscriminate carnage. The number of the slain exceeded that of the slayers. The legionaries had to clamber over heaps of dead to carry on the work of extermination.\"\r\n\r\nMany fled to areas around the Mediterranean. <strong>Titus reportedly refused to accept a wreath of victory, saying that the victory did not come through his own efforts but that he had merely served as an instrument of God's wrath.\r\n\r\n</strong>\r\n<strong>Matthew 25: 11-13 </strong>\r\n‘Later the others also came. “Lord, Lord,” they said, “open the door for us!”\r\n‘But he replied, “Truly I tell you, I don’t know you.”\r\n‘Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.\r\n\r\nThose people who did not believe Jesus and did not leave Jerusalem and kept to the Old Covenant to continue to worship under the Law by offering sacrifices in the Temple all perished. These were virgins who did not prepare themselves. \r\n\r\nIt’s not about you. You are not the virgins. \r\n\r\nChurch. You are the bride. \r\n\r\nI pray that gives you peace. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:1;}"

          "content:encoded": "Coming from a charismatic background, I know we are usually encouraged to give up our desires and who were are to become a super Christian that takes risks, changes the world, pursues God, and stays away from sin. We hear it in songs like\r\n<blockquote>\"Rid me of myself, I belong to you,\" and \"break my heart for what breaks yours... everything I am for your kingdom's cause.\"</blockquote>\r\nAnd in some other denominations, though not directly said, we are generally left with the impression that having an ordinary life is not good enough for God. That if we are not saving the lost, if we are not going to other countries and performing miracles, then somehow our existence is wasted and pointless. After all, our whole purpose here is to save as many people as we can before we die right?\r\n\r\nNow, I don't know any pastor who would want us to have that impression, but none the less some theology leads us to that conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe result is pressure and discontentment. We make assumptions about what God wants for our lives. If it doesn't sound hyper-spiritual or risky then God is not in it.\r\n\r\nIn my own case I felt a lot of pressure to not be a web designer and instead be a pastor or missionary, though web design is what I love. The idea of \"rid me of myself\" meant I had to lay down my ambition as a web designer and pursue what God was asking me to do. However, God saved me from that course one day when I decided to actually ask him personally instead of listening to my discontent conscious. The Lord rebuked me saying,\r\n<blockquote>\"What if I told you that if I've called you to web design then being a pastoral major is actually dishonorable and pointless to me?\"</blockquote>\r\nThat thought rattled my mind. Maybe that line did or didn't come from God, but the point is valid.\r\n\r\nGod has made us each unique with special talents and purposes.\r\n<blockquote>1 Corinthians 12:14-26 <span id=\"en-ESV-28632\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-14\">For the body does not consist of one member but of many.<span style=\"font-size:10px;line-height:10px;\"> </span></span><span id=\"en-ESV-28633\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-15\">If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.</span> <span id=\"en-ESV-28634\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-16\">And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.</span> <span id=\"en-ESV-28635\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-17\">If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?</span> <span id=\"en-ESV-28636\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-18\">But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.</span><span id=\"en-ESV-28637\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-19\"><sup class=\"versenum\"> </sup>If all were a single member, where would the body be?</span> <span id=\"en-ESV-28638\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-20\">As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.</span>\r\n\r\n<span id=\"en-ESV-28639\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-21\">The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”</span> <span id=\"en-ESV-28640\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-22\">On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,</span> <span id=\"en-ESV-28641\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-23\">and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,</span> <span id=\"en-ESV-28642\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-24\">which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,</span> <span id=\"en-ESV-28643\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-25\">that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.</span> <span id=\"en-ESV-28644\" class=\"text 1Cor-12-26\">If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.</span></blockquote>\r\nA few of my other friends and friends of friends have been tempted or given into the pressure to toss aside whatever ambitions they have whether God given or not and try to become this super model christian.\r\n\r\nBut, the past few years for me has been a journey of discovering how easy, free, and ordinary a relationship with God can be.\r\n<blockquote>1 Thessalonians 4:11-12 <span id=\"en-NIV-29615\" class=\"text 1Thess-4-11\">and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you,</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-29616\" class=\"text 1Thess-4-12\">so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.</span></blockquote>\r\nWorking an ordinary job, in an honorable way to please the Lord is just as noble and meaningful as being a missionary in another country. God is not trying to get rid of all of you so he can only see himself. He wants you to be fully you and He wants to be fully Himself to you! He wants you to have desires and ambitions and invite him into every area of your life. Whether as a missionary or a teacher, or a waitress or a banker, God wants to show you kindness and purpose in any area you ask for his help.\r\n\r\nAm I saying God does not call people to be missionaries? Not at all. We need missionaries, just as much as we need bankers. Both have a noble purpose in serving the Lord.\r\n\r\nI used to believe our main purpose in life was saving the lost. But now I do not think that, though that is awesome. I believe our main purpose here is to enjoy a relationship with God no matter what we do. To experience how amazing he can be in big things and in small ordinary life. To enjoy his love and let that inspire us to show his love to others, whether it's leaving 10 dollars for a stranger, buying a friend a coffee, encouraging someone who is discouraged, or helping someone who is needy. And that allows us to be content and casual in our relationship with God. Casual?! Wow! It's hard to think that is how I would describe my relationship with God today. Not fire-burning, not sold-out, not all-of-him, just casual best of friends. I love him with all my heart and I know he loves me. I live in a way that honors him as a web designer and that has become enough for me and I know that right now that is what is pleasing the Lord.\r\n\r\nSo whatever the Lord has called you to, whether it's a busy mom or dad, a blogger, a businessman, a teacher, etc... let yourself be content with where God has you without comparing yourself to other christians. And if it's your ambition to do something greater, tell the Lord that and maybe he will direct your life in that direction.\r\n<blockquote>Proverbs 16:3 \"Commit your actions to the LORD, and your plans will succeed.\"</blockquote>",

There can be wholesomeness in that. It's just that when you approach God, you'll find he's not always asking you to give up everything and before we make assumptions about what God wants we need to talk to him and ask him personally. It's easy to be mislead with that kind of Christianity that doesn't allow for casual lives.",

What you described, the idea that we aren't pleasing God unless we are the idealistic super-Christian, had me in bond age. There is much manipulation involved in these hyped up messages on being a radical, sold out generation or whatever. The thing is, the people who are doing the radical looking stuff typically were just getting to know God and the stuff happened  naturally. \r\n\r\nI would add that the people who preach the need to be a super Christian seldom offer any practical advice on how to attain the grandeur of what they are preaching. So sincere believers end up hyped up and confused rather than enriched in their relationship with God.",

          "content:encoded": "I want to talk about how easy it is to be God's friend. Easy? I think the typical christian's picture of God is someone with high expectations who only talks to the elite people and prophets and is too holy to want a relationship with you. And as long as we just talk about God without actually getting to know him, that may be the conclusion some of us reach. But when you begin to honestly pursue God without trying to put him in any box or expectations you will find that God is a much different person than that.\r\n\r\nGod is kind, slow to anger, gentle and forgiving, he loves mercy, is wise and understanding, and he is the God of all comfort who encourages and strengthens us. He answers our prayers and takes care of all of our needs! He is perfect love. He is not boastful or proud, does not keep record of wrongs, endures all things, is patient, etc... Does this person seem like someone who is hard to be friends with?\r\n\r\nThroughout the Bible we see a God who works on behalf of people, despite their complaining, jealousy, lying, sin, and mess.\r\n\r\nConsider how God gave Rachel children after she was envying Leah's children and asked Jacob to sleep with her servant in <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2030&amp;version=ESV\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2030&amp;version=ESV\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis 30</a>. Consider how God still gave Abraham Isaac after he slept with <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2016\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2016\" target=\"_blank\">Hagar to produce Ishmael</a>. Notice that despite Abraham lying to Pharaoh about his wife being his sister God punished Pharaoh for taking her, not Abraham and that happened not just once but twice. In Exodus 15, the Israelites grumbled that the water was bitter even after they had seen God's provision and deliverance. Yet, God did not crush them or send snakes into their camp, instead he told them how to <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+15\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+15\" target=\"_blank\">turn the bitter water sweet</a>. Consider how God made Jacob into Israel after he wrestled with an angel for a blessing. Notice that Jesus was called the friend of sinners and tax collectors (modern day thieves). He showed grace to the needy but resisted the proud. Jesus came from the line of Judah who had slept with his daughter-in-law while she was disguised as a prostitute. Peter denied Jesus three times. Paul persecuted christians.\r\n\r\nThe Bible is full of examples of people's mess, sin, jealousy, lies, complaining, etc... yet we see a God who worked in the midst of it all to bless, show grace, and meet the desires of their hearts.\r\n\r\nYou do however see a difference in how God related to people after the law was given. After Sinai when the Israelites complained <a title=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+21\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+21\" target=\"_blank\">God sent them trouble instead of answering them</a>. This was because God was relating to them based on a different covenant of works.\r\n\r\nWe today however are not under a covenant of works but of faith because of what Jesus did for us and God relates to us as if we were perfectly righteous.\r\n<blockquote>Hosea 2:16 \"'<span id=\"en-NIV-22122\" class=\"text Hos-2-16\">In that day,' declares the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span>,</span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    '</span><span class=\"text Hos-2-16\">you will call me \"my husband\";</span></span>\r\n<span class=\"indent-1\"><span class=\"indent-1-breaks\">    </span><span class=\"text Hos-2-16\">you will no longer call me \"my master\".</span></span></blockquote>\r\nUnder the new covenant we relate to God as a friend and husband instead of as a slave and master. So I want you to realize, that you don't need to be a super christian who reads their Bible every day and spends an hour in prayer and does all the supposed good christian things to have a fine relationship with God. God will be friends with you as you are and you can develop an intimate relationship with him despite the messes in your life. God welcomes your mess as a way to show off how great he is in every need and situation.\r\n\r\nSo be honest and vulnerable with God. After all, he knows everything your thinking and everything about you. What can you hide from him? Talk to him as a person and friend, someone who cares deeply for you. He is interested in having a relationship with you and makes it easy to do so.",

          "content:encoded": "I am going to talk about something that may not seem relevant to God's grace, but can actually have a big impact on how we live and feel in this world. I have often heard sermons by good teachers that talk about how much worse the world is getting. Either we are coming into a dark time, America is turning away from Christianity, violence is increasing, our government is crumbling, poverty is a gigantic problem, or the world is coming to an end.\r\n\r\nWhat do we usually use to enforce these ideas? The media.\r\n\r\nThe problem with getting our worldview from the media however is it doesn't show us typical events, but sensational events (W. James Potter, The Definition of Media Literacy). This means we are using sensational stories to define how we see the world, which is not actually an accurate representation.\r\n\r\nLet me ask you a question. Do you feel like your faith is going well or has been growing recently in general? Would you say you are declining in your faith overall?\r\n\r\n65% of people think that religion is declining in America. However, 62% of Americans say religion is becoming a stronger influence on their lives (W. James Potter, The Definition of Media Literacy).\r\n\r\nWhat about crime? Do you think crime is getting worse in our country? What with all the horrible stories we see on the news? Would you think that most crimes are violent?\r\n<blockquote>But in reality, less than 20% of all crime is violent. More than 80% of all crime is property crime, with the victim not even present (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2000). Furthermore, the rate for violent crime has been declining in this country since the mid-1980s, yet very few people are aware of this decline (Whitman &amp; Loftus, 1996). Instead, most people believe that violent crime is increasing because they continually see crime stories and gory images in the media. They have fashioned their opinions on sensationalized events, and this type of information provides no useful basis to infer an accurate picture about crime (W. James Potter)</blockquote>\r\nI want to encourage you to take a look at <a title=\"http://www.gapminder.org/data/\" href=\"http://www.gapminder.org/data/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.gapminder.org/data/</a>. The world's data on many subjects was more recently released to the public. We can see things like the number of people affected by earthquakes, the average income for people in different countries, life expectancy, etc...\r\n\r\nIn my own observations of these statistics, I would conclude the world is getting better not worse.

It's important we are not assuming the worst about our world and reacting to it in an inappropriate way or basing our theology on what the news presents to us. It can leave us discouraged, stressed, worried, or sometimes acting radically inappropriate.\r\n\r\nCould it be that we are not escalating to dooms day but we are actually making progress? No doubt there are serious problems in parts of the world, but what about all the good?",

This seemingly obscure part of the law contains the story of creation and redemption and points to the cross where all would be made right.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"en-NLT-29076\" class=\"text Gal-3-13\"><em>But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law. When he was hung on the cross, he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing. For it is written in the Scriptures, âCursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.â (Gal. 3:13 NLT)</em>\r\n</span>\r\n\r\nThe opening story in the Bible contained a couple of trees as well. One of these trees would bring a curse upon them that ate from it and the other would produce blessings. One was about knowledge of right and wrong (and the attempt to live accordingly) and the other was about relationship that produced life.\r\n\r\nYou know the story. Man ate from the wrong tree. But it does not stop there. Though man <img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2602\" src=\"http://revelationsingrace.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/treeoflife.jpg\" alt=\"treeoflife\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" data-originalSrc=\"https://soaringingrace.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/treeoflife.jpg\" data-rehosted=\"1\">was banished from the tree of life, little did he know the tree of life was coming after him! In fact, banishing man from the tree of life was an act of mercy. As we see from the conversation amongst the Trinity:\r\n\r\n<em><span id=\"en-NASB-78\" class=\"text Gen-3-22\">Then the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God said, âBehold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live foreverââ</span> <span id=\"en-NASB-79\" class=\"text Gen-3-23\">therefore the <span class=\"small-caps\">Lord</span> God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he was taken (Gen. 3:22-23).</span></em>\r\n\r\nGod did not want them to live forever in their fallen state. Jesus came to get us out of the mess and make it so we could live forever in a redeemed sinless state.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"en-NIV-26235\" class=\"text John-5-24\"><span class=\"woj\"><em>Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. (John 5:24)</em>\r\n</span></span>\r\n\r\nBut in order for us to cross over from death to life, we needed to be stripped of our old nature and forgiven our debt to the law. Christ being nailed to the cross was our debt to the law being paid. As Paul told the Colossians,<em> \"<span id=\"en-NIV-29508\" class=\"text Col-2-13\">God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,</span> <span id=\"en-NIV-29509\" class=\"text Col-2-14\">having canceled the charge of our legal indebtedness, which stood against us and condemned us; he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross.</span>\" (Col. 2:13b-14 NIV)</em>\r\n\r\nJesus, the tree of life, was nailed to the cross for the sins recorded by the law. In this way, justice against sin (which was also mercy for us) was served. One might say that the cross was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. I find great comfort in this. Even though man made the wrong choice, the right choice came after him.\r\n\r\nJesus made the right choice for us. He kept the law perfectly and then died for the transgressions of the law. In this way, He became our perfect High Priest and Author of salvation.\r\n\r\n<span id=\"en-MSG-12022\" class=\"text Rom-5-6-Rom-5-8\"><em>Christ arrives right on time to make this happen. He didnât, and doesnât, wait for us to get ready. He presented himself for this sacrificial death when we were far too weak and rebellious to do anything to get ourselves ready... (Rom. 5:6-7 MSG)</em>\r\n</span>\r\n\r\nI have heard believers worry about falling into this sin or that trap. Afraid of the flesh and the devil which could cause them to fall away. Don't be condemned, be encouraged!\r\n\r\nJesus has provided a perfect salvation. Not only was His priestly work as our Substitute on Earth complete as He obeyed the Father and carried our sin but He lives forever as our Heavenly priest to make sure we receive what He purchased.\r\n\r\nThis is why we now preach what Paul called the obedience <em>of faith. </em>Some think that Christ came to simply model for us how to keep the law. Some go further and say that He even writes the laws of Moses on our hearts (as it does say God will write His laws on our hearts under the New Covenant).\r\n\r\nBut if you read through the NT, you will find that God does not relate to us on the basis of law anymore while under grace. He does not simply empower us to try to keep the law. This would be returning to the wrong tree! He told us not to eat from the tree of law (knowledge of good and evil).\r\n\r\nChrist fulfilled the law covenant and severed our relationship to the law. He uprooted that tree from our hearts so we can have relationship with Him based on love and faith rather than trying to mend the relationship with our old husband of law. This is why Paul said the following concerning our marriage to the law covenant:\r\n\r\n<em><span id=\"en-NIV-28096\" class=\"text Rom-7-4\"><span id=\"en-NASB-28096\" class=\"text Rom-7-4\">Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. (Rom. 7:4, NASB)\r\n</span></span></em>\r\n\r\nIt seems there is confusion about this in the church. We say things like, \"Well Christ set us free from the sacrificial and ceremonial laws, but we still must keep the moral laws.\" However, the Bible makes no distinction; law is law (see James 2:10). I am not saying it is okay in committing adultery and murder. I am saying that God does not want our focus to be on our performance but on His. He wants to engage us in intimate relationship that focuses on following a Person, not a rule book. He paid a price so we could eat from the tree of life again.\r\n\r\nThe book of Hebrews, which is all about the transition from Old to New Covenant has this to say about the topic:\r\n\r\n<em><span id=\"en-NASB-30119\" class=\"text Heb-9-13\">For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,</span>Â </em><span id=\"en-NASB-30120\" class=\"text Heb-9-14\"><em> how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanseÂ your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? (Heb. 9:13-14 NASB)</em>\r\n</span>\r\n\r\nOur conscience must be cleansed from the affects of eating from the wrong tree. That tree is what causes man to cling to a law base system to succeed in life and approach God. Nothing but the blood of Jesus could get the job done. He is the tree of life.\r\n\r\n<em><span id=\"en-NIV-28120\" class=\"text Rom-8-3\">For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh,God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in the flesh,</span>Â <span id=\"en-NIV-28121\" class=\"text Rom-8-4\"> in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. (Rom. 8:3-4 NIV)</span></em>\r\n\r\n </div>\";s:15:\"images_mirrored\";i:1;}"
